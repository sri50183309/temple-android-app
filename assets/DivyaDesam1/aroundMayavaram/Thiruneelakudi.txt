<p><b>History:</b></p>
<p>Of  the six centers in the human body known as Mooladhara, Swadishtana,  Manipuraka, Anagatham, Vishuddhi and Aggna, Thiruneelakudi represents  the Mooladhara position helping the devotee to raise the Kundalini  Sakthi.</p>
<p>Rishi Markandeya wanted to lengthen his longevity.  Devarishi Naradha advised Markandeya to worship Shiva in Thiruneelakudi  which he meticulously followed. The Lord appeared before him and asked  him of his desire. Markandeya told the Lord his wish and got back  eternity of longevity. The grateful Markandeya took the Lord in a  palanquin to Ilandalai, Enadhimangalam, Thirunageswaram, Thirupuvanam,  Thiruvidaimarudhur, Maruthuvakudi and other places. The Chithirai  Thiruvizha (April-May) is celebrated remembering this event.<br />

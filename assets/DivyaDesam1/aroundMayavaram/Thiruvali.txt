<p>ThiruMangai way lays the Lord!!<br />
At  Vedarajapuram, a village in between Thiruvali and Thirunagari,  Thirumangai Mannan stops the Lord in an effort to relieve him of his  belongings. It is here that the Lord reveals his true form and utters  the Astaachara Mandiram in the ears of Mangai Mannan. This entire event  is enacted here every year on the first day of Panguni Uthiram.</p>
<p>Being the place where Lord Vishnu appeared to share the Thiru Manthiram, Thiruvaali is said to be equivalent to Badri.</p>
<p>Accepting  the prayers of the Devas (they wanted Goddess Lakshmi to help protect  the world from any further destruction after the Lord had slain  Hiranyakashipu), the Goddess came here and sat on the Lord's right  thigh. Hence, this place came to be called 'Thiru'Vali.</p>

<p><b>The story</b><br />
Brahmma's  son Karthama Prajaapathi undertook penance at Thirunagari wanting  Moksham. With Lord Vishnu refusing to consider Goddess' request of  providing Moksham to Prajaapathi, an upset Lakshmi left Paramapatham and  hid herself here at Thirunagari. Missing her presence, Lord came down  in search and finally found her in a pond here. Hence this place came to  be called'Thiru'(Sri) Nagari, to mark the event of Goddess Lakshmi  having stayed here.</p>
<p>While  the Lord informed Prajaapathi that there was still time left for  Moksham, he offered to grant any other wishes to Brahmma's son. Though  dejected, Prajaapathi requested that the Lord and Goddess remain here in  the same form so all the devotees could have darshan.</p>
<p>Thirumangai Azhvaar seen with his trademark spear (Vel)<br />

Thirumangai,  who had won over Thirugnana Sambandhar(seen earlier in the Seerkazhi  Kaazhi Cheerama Vinnagaram story) is seen here like a hunter with a  spear.</p>
<p>Thirumangai  had a golden sculpture of his done at Thirukurungudi. It is believed  that he transferred all his powers to this sculpture before he attained  Moksham at Thirukurungudi. This idol was then moved to Thirunagari, near  the birth place of Thirumangai Azhvaar and to date remains the idol of  Thirumangai, on whom the daily pooja is undertaken here at ThiruNagari.</p>
<p>To  win over his sweet heart Kumudavalli, Thirumangai fed a 1000  vaishnavites here as per the condition laid down by her). To this day,  one can see the mandapam, called Mangai Mutt, where Thirumangai fed  these Vaishnavites.</p>

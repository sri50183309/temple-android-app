<h1>KaazhiCheeraama Vinnagaram</h1>
<p>Kaazhi Cheeraama Vinnagaram in Seerkazhi is about 235 kms South of Madras on Madras-Mayilaaduthurai route.</p>
<p>This  is one of the five Divya Desams referred by Thirumangai Azhvaar as  'Vinnagaram'. The others being Parameswara Vinnagaram (Kanchipuram),  Arimeya Vinnagara(Thiru Naangur), Vaikunta Vinnagaram (ThiruNaangur) and  Nandipura Vinnagaram(Nathan Koil, Kumbakonam). Another feature of  Thirumangai's praise of this Divya Desam is his reference to the Goddess  in his Paasurams.</p>
<p><b>The Story</b><br />
Brahmma  had grown arrogant about his life span. To defuse his arrogance, Sage  Romasa invoked the blessings of Lord Vishnu and was granted a boon,  wherey for every hair lock that fell from the Rishi, Brahmma's life time  would reduce by a year. Asked what else he wanted, the sage asked for  the Lord to display his Trivikrama form at this place. This is said to  be the place where Lord Vishnu in his Vaamana Avataaram measured his  first step. At this Divya Desam, only the left foot of the Lord can be  seen every day. The right foot can be seen only once a year on the  Vaikunta Ekadesi day.</p>
<p><b>Thirumangai Azhvaar blocked at Seerkazhi</b><br />
It  is here at Seerkazhi that the great Saivite poet Thiru Gnana Sambandhar  met with the Great Vaishnavite saint poet Thiru Mangai Mannan and  engaged in a debate.</p>
<p>After  visiting Thiru Chitrakoodam (Chidambaram), Thirumangai Mannan was on  his way to Seerkazhi. All the way his subjects sang praise of him  uttering different names of Mangai Mannan. The praise of Thirumangai by  his subjects angered the disciples of Thiru Gnana Sambandhar. They  blocked Thirumangai and asked his followers not to shout praises of  ThiruMangai in this birthplace of Thiru Gnana Sambandhar. They wanted  Thirumangai to meet Thiru Gnana Sambandhar and win over him, before  continuing with their praise of <b>Thirumangai.</b></p>
<p><b>Debate between Thiru Mangai and Thiru Gnana Sambandhar</b><br />

In  the first meeting between Thiru Mangai and Thiru Gnana Sambandhar, the  Vaishnavite poet answered fluently each of Thiru Gnana Sambandhar's  questions and let out 10 verses of praise in the name of Vishnu.</p>
<p>"Oru Kuralaai, Iru Nilam Moovadiman Vendi<br />

<p>Pleased  and impressed with Mangai Mannan's knowledge and the sweetness in his  praise and description of the different forms of Vishnu, a spell bound  Thiru Gnana Sambandhar acknowledged the greatness of Thirumangai and  crowned him as 'Mangai Azhvaar' and presented him with the 'Vel'(spear).  Among the Azhvaars, Thiru Mangai is the only one who has been crowned  with the 'Vel'.</p>

<h1>Sri Kolavilli Ramar kovil - Thiruvelliyankudi</h1>
<p><b>Temple Location :</b></p>
<p>This  temple lies in the District of Tanjore, Tamil Nadu. From Kumbakonam, we  have to travel in a bus upto Anaikarai and from there to Senganoor and  the temple is about 3/4 miles away from this place. The Sthalam can also  be reached Via Chozhavaram, Muttakudi and Mayavaram.</p>
<p><b>Sthala Puranam: </b></p>
<p>As  Lord Shukra (Venus) also known as Velli was in penance on this place  and because of this, the sthalam is called as "Velliankudi".</p>
<p>Among all the Planet's Lord Shukra has an important place. He is the next brightest star to Sun and Moon.</p>
<p>He  was the guru (mentor) of the Asura's (demons). He was the one who  taught the life Regaining Mantra "The Sanjeevini Manthram" to Kachan,  the son of Brahaspathi, the guru of Deva's.</p>
<p>Mayan  was the sculptor of the Deva Logam. He is the father of Mandorai, wife  of Ravana. He constructed many beautiful places such as Tiripura loga  which floats in the sky (for Asura's) etc. This great personality wanted  to have a heartiful Dharsan of Sri Ramar. He requested Sri Ramar to  give Dharsan without his Sangu and Chakaram. So Sri Ramar gave these  things to Garudan and showed himself as "Kola Vallvill Raman" at this  place.</p>
<p>And Garudan  has Sangu and Chakkaram in his hands here. This incident shows that a  true artist is beyond love and affection towards his family (ie) he is  more concentrated in his work only. So, Lord Bhrama too came here to  have Dharsan.</p>

<p>Many Sages and Saints have performed the "Vyasa Pooja" here.</p>
<p><b>This temple is maintained under the "Vygnasa Agamam" which means:</b></p>
<p>Viganasa  Maharishi was born from the soul of Sriman Narayanan. The format of  Slokams which he assorted is known as "Vyganasa Aagamam", the Four Lakh  Granda's (letter format) which was formed by his four students  Maharishi, Athiri, Bhrigu and Kashiyapar is also known as Vyganasam.</p>
<p>Bodily  matters were put into the Gruhyam sect while details regarding the  implantation of idols of deities, prayers, rules for repenting his sins  (Prayachitham) are put under the Deivegam section.</p>
<p>As all the wordly bliss are found here, mother earth (ie) Bhoomi Piratti came here to get the Dharsan of the Lord here.</p>
<p>Like  how Plaintain tree bores sapplings before it dies, the humanity should  also cherish forever and to explian this, the sthala virutcham (ie) tree  of the temple is Plaintain tree here.</p>
<p>Putkalavartham  is the name of the cloud which bores all blissful things to humanity.  As the lord of this place bless us heartly, the Pushkalavartha cloud  become his Vimaanam here.</p>

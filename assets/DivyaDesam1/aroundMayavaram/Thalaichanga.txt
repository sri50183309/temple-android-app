<h1>Thalaichanga Naanmathiyam</h1>
<p>The place where Chandran was liberated from his curse</p>
<p>Thalaichanga Naanmathiyam Divya Desam in Thalaichangadu, once a commercial hub<br />
(it is believed that Conches were special at this place ) now wears almost a deserted look.</p>
<p>Located  12 kms East of Seerkazhi on the Nagapatinam State Highway, this  historical temple said to be over a 1000 years old has connections with  the Srirangam and Thiru Indhalur temples.</p>
<p>A  redeeming feature is the commitment and devotion of Varadarajan  Bhattar, who travels 16kms by bus every morning from Mayavaram.</p>
<p>The Story- Chandran liberated from curse<br />
Chandran,  who was learning under the tutelage of Guru Brihaspathi, once cast an  evil eye on the wife of his Guru, whose curse turned Chandran into a  disease prone body.</p>
<p>Another  story goes that Dakshan gave his many daughters to Chandran after being  impressed with his handsome looks. However, Chandran fell in love only  with Rohini and disregarded the others. Dakshan viewed that Chandran had  become arrogant as a result of his good looks and cursed Chandran, who  lost his 'personality'.</p>

<p>Chandran  turned to Lord Vishnu for liberation from the curse and is said to have  undertaken the following steps as directed by the Lord:.</p>
<p>Step 1- Chandran is said to have bathed and done Kainkaryam at Srirangam for 15 years and got liberated from his 'body disease'.</p>
<p>Step  2- After bathing at Thiru Indhalur and offering prayers to Parimala  Rangan, he had his sins reduced. As per his request, this place came to  be called Indhunna (a name denoting Chandran) and this region was  referred to as Chandran Kshetram.</p>
<p>Finally,  he came to Thalaichangadu Kshetram, bathed in the temple tank here and  undertook penance. Lord Vishnu, along with Goddess, is said to have  appeared before him in the Chandra Vimaanam and liberated him from all  his curses. Hence the Lord's name here is Chandra Saabha Haran.</p>
<p>Chandran  requested that the Lord fulfil all the wishes of the devotees who pray  sincerely to him at this temple, just as he did. Hence, the Lord here is  referred to as Naan Maathiyam Perumal.</p>

<p>Thirumangai Azhvaar's Praise<br />
Lured by the beauty of the Lord, Thirumangai, sitting in Thirukannapuram (south west of this temple), sings:<br />
'Kannar Kannapuram Kadigai, Thannar Thamari Soozh<br />

Thalai Changa Vinnal Naan Mathiya<br />
Veriginra Ven Sudaraal Kannara Kandu Kandu<br />
Kali Kinrandu Ingu Endugola'</p>
<p>In the Siriya Thiru Madal, Thirumangai refers to the special sacred water at this temple:<br />
"Mannum Mani Mada Koil, Manaalana Naneer<br />
Thalai Changa Naan Madiyanaai"</p>

<p>To this day, the sacred water (Theertham) tastes special here at this temple.</p>

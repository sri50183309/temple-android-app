<p>Ther Ezhendur - The capital of Karikala Chozhan I Standing posture of Garuda alongside the Lord is a unique feature<br />
Birth Place of Kamban</p>
<p>The  capital of Karikala Chozhan I and the birth place of the great Tamil  poet Kamban, Ther Ezhendur (ThiruVazhandur), a Krishnaranya Kshetram, is  situated 11kms West of Mayavaram.A tall and handsome 12 feet Lord  DevathiRajan is flanked on his right by Prahalad and on his left by  Garuda.</p>
<p>Krishnaranya Kshetram- The story of Krishna coming here to Thiru Vazhandur</p>
<p>Once  Brahmma took away the herd of cows which were grazing around in Gokulam  while Krishna was having bath on the banks of Yamuna, and brought them  to Thiru Vazhandur. Krishna came back and through his powers found out  what had happened. Instantly, he created the same number of cows at  Gokulam.</p>
<p>Realising  his folly, Brahmma approached Krishna and requested him to give darshan  at Thiru Vazhandur. Accepting his request, Krishna appears as  Aamaruviyappan (Gosakan in Sanskrit) in his 'divine form' along with a  cow by the side of his back and a calf in front of him, a beautiful  sight that one is not witness to in any of the other Krishnaranya Divya  Desam Kshetram. This is a speciality of this Krishnaranya Kshetram.</p>
<p>The other Krishnaranya Kshetrams are Thiru Kannangudi, Kapisthalam, Thiru Kannapuram and Thiru Kannamangai.</p>
<p>'Ther- Ezhandur'<br />

King  Ubarisaravasu had the power to fly, courtesy a boon he had received.  With this, he had become arrogant and incurred the wrath of the rishis,  whose curse resulted in the chariot coming crashing down into this place  .</p>
<p>Another  story goes that Lord Krishna's cows were destroyed when King  Ubarisaravasu's chariot's shadow fell on them (It is believed that  Ubarisaravasu had obtained this quite special boon that anyone on whom  his chariot's shadow falls would get into trouble). Wanting to teach the  king a lesson, Krishna pierced the chariot to prevent the chariot from  flying any further. The Chariot came thudding down into this place and  got stuck here.</p>

<p>Hence, the name Ther Ezhendur (Ther= Chariot)</p>
<p>A Unique Feature- Garuda alongside Lord DevathiRajan</p>
<p>Indra  once presented Garuda a gold ornament and a vimanam. It is said that  Garuda gave the Vimanam at this temple at Thiru Vazhandur( the Gold  ornament was given to Thiru Narayanan at Melkote near Mysore). Happy at  this gesture of Garuda, the Lord accorded him a special status at this  temple with a position alongside him at the sanctum sanctorum, a unique  feature at a Divya Desam. Normally one finds Garuda opposite the Lord  but here he is seen next to the Lord Himself.</p>
<p>Prahalad wants a 'softer' darshan!!!</p>
<p>Prahalad  who had seen an aggressive and angry Lord Vishnu killing Hiranyakashipu  in his Narasimha Avataar undertook penance here wanting to see a  softer, quieter version of the Lord. Legend has it that the Lord gave  darshan to Prahalad here in his not so 'angry form'. One finds Prahalad  alongside DevathiRajan, another unique feature.</p>
<p>Cauvery's Penance at TherEzhendur</p>

<p>Sage  Agasthya wanted to wed Cauvery. When she refused, the sage locked her  here. Cauvery escaped from this place only to be cursed by the Sage who  said Let the place where Cauvery goes be in trouble'. Cauvery  undertook penance here at TherEzhendur to get liberated from the curse  of Sage Agasthiya.</p>
<p>This  is the birth place of the famous Tamil poet Kamban ( Kamban wrote the  Ramayana in Tamil). There is a separate sannidhi for Kamban at this  temple. The place where Kamban resided, on the Sannidhi street, has now  been turned into a beautiful new 'Kamban Mandapam'.</p>
<p>It is believed that this was the place where Sage Markandeya performed penance here to get Moksham.</p>
<p>It  has become so much an attraction that a couple of North Indian folks(  no Tamil knowledge), who are working in a nearby company, have turned up  here regularly to listen to the Azhvaar Paasuram recited by the  Bhattar.<br />
1 year ago(end of 2007), young children of Therezhendur used  this temple tank as a cricket play ground. It was dry and with well  grown grass and bushes in the corners. Today, it is a delightful sight  as one enters the temple to see the tank brimming with water, although  it will leave the children a little disappointed that they will not be  able to play anymore in the tank.</p>

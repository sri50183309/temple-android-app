<h1>Thiru Kannapuram</h1>
<p>Located  20kms North West of Nagapatinam (20kms East of Tiruvarur, 30kms South  of Kumbakonam and Mayavaram), this is one of the 5 Krishnaranya  Kshetrams. Lord Narayana himself re-incarnated as Sowri Rajan at  Kannapuram.</p>
<p><b>Walking Beauty of the Lord</b><br />
This  is the temple where the Lord showed Vibheeshana, brother of Ravana, his  walking beauty. After seeing the sleeping beauty of Vishnu as Lord  Ranganatha at Srirangam, Vibheeshna wanted to see the walking beauty of  the Lord, upon which he was directed by the Lord to his "Keezh(akku)  Veedu" (Eastern Gateway of the Lord). It is believed that Lord Vishnu  displayed his 'walking beauty' to Vibheeshana here on the new moon day.  To mark this event, on every Amavasya day at 12noon, Lord SowriRajan is  carried out of the Sanctum and walks to the Vibheeshna Sannidhi.</p>
<p>Sowri Rajan- An extra growth of hair on the Lord</p>
<p>Once  a garland of flowers sent by a king to the Lord did not reach the  temple and hence the priest could not get the Lord ready in time for the  King's visit. To save himself from the King's wrath, the temple priest  quickly organized a garland of flowers from his house and placed it  around the Lord. The king found that there was a hair in the garland and  questioned the priest, who told him that this was the Lord's own.</p>
<p>The  priest told the king that he would show it(the Lord's hair) to him the  next morning. Lord here is said to have saved the priest by displaying  his long plait to the King. Hence, the lord here is called Sowri Rajan.</p>
<p>Special Pongal every night</p>
<p>A  devotee who used to have his daily food only after presenting to the  Lord was late one evening and found the temple closed. Hence, he  presented the food to the Lord from outside the temple. It is believed  that when the temple doors opened the next morning, the entire temple  smelt of Sweet Pongal.</p>

<p>To mark this, every night, Pongal is served to the Lord - another feature at this temple.</p>

<p>Lord Narayana in 3 forms</p>

(TriMoorthy Swaroopam)- Maha Vishnu in the day, Brahmaa in the night at around 11pm and Lord Shiva early next morning</p>
<p><b>Procession to the Sea Shore</b></p>
<p>Once  a year, on the occasion of Maasi Magam, the Lord is taken on a  procession to the sea shore near Karaikal, about 20 kms from here.</p>

<h1>Thiru Nagai</h1>
<p>The sea port town of Nagapattinam is home to the beautiful Divya Desam of Soundara Raja Perumal.</p>
<p>Thiru  Mangai Azhvaar is said to have been so lured by the beauty of the tall  and lanky Lord Soundara Rajan that he imagined himself as a lady  (Nayaki) to admire better the beauty of the Lord. In almost each of the  10 Paasurams that Thiru Mangai Azhvaar composed in praise of Soundara  Raja Perumal, one can see him admiring his beauty.</p>

Achho Oruvar Azhagiya Vaa.."- 1758<br />
("O  Sister, his face has a golden hue.He ran his eyes over me, he saw my  slender waist, I dread that look on my mother's face.Isn't he  beautiful") - Here the Azhvaar addresses the Goddess.</p>
<p>'Achho' is a phrase used to show our excitement when we see something that keeps us 'spell bound'.</p>
<p>The  temple is said to have been constructed by the Naaga Kings, improved  upon and renovated later by the Maratha rulers and the Nayak Kings.</p>
<p>Fame across 4 Yugams</p>

<p>The  fame of this temple is distinct and dates back across each of the 4  Yugams. In Kretha Yugam, the king of Nagas ( Serpent Lord) undertook  penance here. Pleased with this, Lord Vishnu agreed to accept Adisesh as  the one on whom he would rest 'always'. Since the Serpent Lord bagged  this big gift from the Lord, this place has come to be called 'Naagar'  Pattinam.</p>
<p>It was here that Bhooma Devi, in Tretha Yugam, and 'Markandeya' Rishi, in Dwapara Yugam, undertook penance.</p>
<p>Another  story goes that Druva, a young kid (son of King Uthana patha) undertook  deep penance wanting to rule the entire world. So pleased was the Lord  that he came on the Garuda Vaahanam to grant Druva's wish. However, on  seeing the beautiful Lord, Druva's mind changed, and dramatically so.  Instead of wanting to reign the world, Druva requested the Lord to grant  him Moksham and of seeing his beauty all the time at this temple.</p>
<p>It is believed that Naga Raja performed Kanniga Dhanam at this kshetram</p>

<p>All three Postures of the Lord</p>
<p>Lord  can be seen in all 3 kolams here - standing, sleeping and sitting  posture and is said to have given Darshan in each of these 3 postures to  Naga Raja.</p>
<p>Thiru  Mangai Azhvaar, in his Paasurams, compares Lord Soundara Rajan to  Sarangapani of Kumbakonam, Sathya Moorthy of Thiru Maiyam, Kallarpiran  of Sri Vaikuntam and Kall Azhagar of Thiru Maliruncholai, among a few  others.</p>

<p>A Unique Narasimha statue</p>
<p>There  is a bronze statue of Narasimha where he is seen blessing Prahalad with  one hand and destroying Hiranyakashipu with his other hands.</p>
<p>Temple Tower as a Light House</p>
<p>In  days gone by, the 7 tiered Gopuram of this Divya Desam had a light atop  the tower that served as a 'light house' for ships coming into and  crossing Nagapattinam.</p>
<p>Worship services are of the highest order at this temple and is done in strict Vaishnavite principles.</p>

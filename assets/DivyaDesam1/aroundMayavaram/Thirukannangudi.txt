<h1>Thiru Kannangudi</h1>
<p>Four Interesting events mark Thirmangai Azhvaar's stay at Kannankudi</p>
<p>Located  about 8kms West of Nagapattinam, off the Nagapattinam- Thiruvarur  Highway, is Damodara Narayanan Divya Desam in Thiru Kannangudi, which is  also part of the Pancha Krishna Kshetram. This is the final point of  Krishnaranya Kshetram, which begins at Naachiyar Koil in Thiru Naraiyur  and passes through Thiru Cherai, Kannamangai and Kannapuram.</p>
<p>Sage Vashishta and Lord Krishna<br />
The  story goes that, Lord Krishna, pleased with Vashishta's penance,  appeared before the sage in the form of a kid. While the Sage was  immersed in thoughts of the Lord, Kannan picked up the butter, swallowed  it in one go and gave Vashishta the run.</p>
<p>With  Vashishta giving him a chase, young Kannan runs through the  Krishnaranya Kshetram until he came upon the rishis, who were undergoing  penance here. Thrilled to see Kannan come their way, the rishis blocked  him.</p>
<p>Explaining  his hurry, Kannan wanted them to ask for one wish. By this time,  Vashishta too had caught up with the Lord and he fell at his feet. The  rishis wanted the Lord to provide darshan to other devotees in this same  standing posture at this place. Hence this place came to be called  Kannankudi.</p>
<p>4 Interesting stories relating to ThiruMangai's experience at Thiru Kannangudi</p>
<p>1. Thirumangai's praise of the Tamarind tree<br />

Thirumangai  Azhvaar who was to build the huge walls of Srirangam temple came to  Nagai to pick up the golden statue of Buddha. On his way back, a tired  Thirumangai wanted rest and lay under a Tamarind tree at Thiru  Kannankudi. Placing the gold in the pit there, Thirumangai asked the  tree to wake him up if someone came there. The next morning when the  owner of the plot arrived to resume work, the tamarind tree dropped its  leaves on Thirumangai to wake up the Azhvaar.</p>
<p>2. Pending cases at Kannankudi<br />
Thirumangai  and the owner of the plot argued about its ownership. Thirumangai  defended himself saying his papers were in Srirangam and that he would  come back in a day or two with the papers. Thirumangai never came back  and the case is said to have remained pending. Disputes in  ThiruKannangudi don't see a quick decision.</p>

<p>3. Dry Wells at Thiru Kannangudi<br />
A  thirsty Thirumangai is said to have walked up to the ladies near the  well and asked for water. Having heard about his arguments regarding the  ownership of the plot, they were worried that he would fight with them  on the ownership of the well and hence refused him a pot of water. An  angry Thiru Mangai Azhvaar pronounced a curse stating that the water  would not fill up in the well. To this day, wells in Thiru Kannankudi  are seen dried up. Even when it fills up, it tastes salty.</p>
<p>4. Lord quenches Thirumangai's thirst<br />
The  Lord of Thiru Kannankudi is said to have come and presented a tired and  thirsty Thiru Mangai with food and water. With Thiru Mangai finishing  his food, the Lord is said to have disappeared.</p>

<p>Left  wondering, Thirumangai, on his way back, met a man who seemed like one  with conch and chakra but disappeared almost immediately. It is believed  that Thirumangai had earlier answered the Lord's enquiry about his  background saying he was a vagabond. Hence, the Lord is believed to have  given him just one quick glimpse of his full vision and then  disappeared.</p>
<p><b>Pancha Krishna Kshetram</b><br />
ThiruKannankudi  is part of the Pancha Krishna Kshetram, the others being Kapisthalam,  ThiruKovilur, Thiru Kannamangai and Thiru Kannapuram.</p>

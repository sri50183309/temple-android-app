<h1>Thiru Indhalur</h1>
<p>Located  at Thiru Indalur about 2kms from the Mayavaram bus stand on the  northern banks of Cauvery, Parmila Rangan Perumal temple is a Pancha  Ranga Kshetram. With Adhiseshan on top, Lord Parimala Rangan can be seen  in a grand sleeping posture with 4 hands, Goddess Cauvery by the side  of his head, to his right and Goddess Ganga by the side of his leg.</p>
<p>Argument between Thiru Mangai Azhvaar and Lord Parimala Rangan</p>
<p>The  story goes that Lord Parimala Rangan shut the door on ThiruMangai  Azhvaar, who had come for his darshan, reasoning that he was late. Upset  at this, ThiruMangai Azhvaar gets into an argument with Lord Parimala  Ranganathar.</p>
<p>When  a friend keeps a thing that we want and does not want to share with us,  we typically say 'keep it to yourself' in jest. Similarly, here, with  the Lord not allowing Thirumangai Azhvaar an entry into the temple, the  Azhvaar asked Parimala Rangan to keep all his beauty to himself and to  enjoy it on his own.</p>
<p>ThiruMangai  Azhvaar goes on to argue that the world will talk about the Lord in bad  light as he shut the door on the Azhvaar. The Lord ignores this comment  of the Azhvaar saying that he need not worry about it and that he will  take care of any ill feelings.</p>
<p>Despite  repeated attempts to impress the Lord to allow him an entry, Parimala  Rangan maintains his silence. A dejected and frustratedThiru Mangai  Azhvaar decided that he would leave the place as the Lord was stubborn  at not allowing Darshan to the Azhvaar.</p>
<p>Thiru  Mangai Azhvaar in his Paasuram(1331) says 'Vaasi Valleer Indhalureer  Vazhnthey Pomneerey..' to mean that ' I am leaving, you yourself live  here and enjoy life'.</p>
<p>Sensing  that Thiru Mangai Azhvaar may leave the place without praising him  enough, Lord Parimala Rangan tries to prolong the argument and asks him  to sing praise of him. Thiru Mangai Azhvaar replies saying “How can I  shower praise on you when you do not allow me to see you". Lord Parimala  Ranga says " You who have sung praises of other Lords, sitting in your  place, do sing praise of me too so I can listen to your sweet songs."  ThiruMangai Azhvaar finally falls for it and composes 10 Paasurams.</p>

<p>Pancha Ranga Kshetram</p>
<p>Another  speciality of this temple is that the Indhalur Parimala Ranga temple is  a Pancha Ranga Kshetram. The other Pancha Ranga Kshetrams are Srirangam  Ranganatha, Srirangapatnam Ranganatha, Koviladi Appaala Ranganathar and  Kumbakonam Aaravamuthan.</p>
<p>Why the Name Indhalur</p>
<p>Chandran  (The Moon God) undertook penance here and was liberated, from his  curse, by the Lord here. Chandran (another name of Chandran is Indhu)  requested that this place be called Indhalur in his memory.</p>
<p>Month Long Festival in Aipasi</p>
<p>It  is believed that a bath in the Cauvery here during Aipasi is said to be  more sacred than bathing at the Ganges. During this month, the temple  attracts devotees from across the country.</p>
<p>It is believed that King Ambarish built this temple. There are several beautiful sculptures inside this temple.</p>

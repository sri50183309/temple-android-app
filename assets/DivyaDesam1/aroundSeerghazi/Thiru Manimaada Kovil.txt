<h1>Sri Narayana Perumal Temple,Thiru Manimaada Kovil - Seergazhi</h1>
<p><b>About the Temple &amp; Location:</b></p>
<p>This  sthalam is one among the Thirunaangur Divyadesam and lies in  Thirunaangur in Tanjore district in Tamil Nadu. It's about 5 miles away  from Seerkazhi. Bus facilities are also available.</p>
<p><b>Sthala Puranam:</b></p>
<p>Nanda  Vilakku means the lamp which gives light continuously. Here the perumal  stands as this Nanda Vilakku giving the Pranava Gyana oli ie Pranavam  means the word "Om" which is the key sound of the whole universe.</p>
<p>Ajaykapathan,  Aahirputheyar, Binanai, Roodhar, Pithuroopar, Thriyambakar, Maheswarar,  Virushakabi, Shambuvahanar, Easwarar all the above 10 are known as  Ekadasa Rudhirar.</p>
<p>Ajaykapathan  was once the carrier of Lord Shiva who was having 4 mouths, 1000  shoulders, Karala Vadhanam, ears with shell earrings and 100 legs.</p>

<p>Aahirputheyan is the son of Maharishi Boothan and Surabi.</p>
<p>Binaki  is actually a bow which was formed by Lord Indra. Once Kanva Maharishi  who brought up shakuntala was in a deep prayer and was covered by Sand  dunes. Bamboo trees started to grow on the top and seeing the finest  quality of these Bamboo's, Lord Indra made 3 bows out of them. He named  the first one as Kandibam and kept it for himself. The other one was  named Shargam and was given to Lord Narayana and the third one was named  Binaki and was given to Lord shiva.</p>
<p>Maheswarar has the body and ornaments as Lord Shiva but is of white colour.As  Lord Narayana gave his dharsan to Lord Shiva who was received from the  sin of killing Lord Brahma. Narayana gave these Ekadasa Rudhirar's too  his special dharsan.</p>
<p>Once  saint Dhurvasan gave a garland which was used in the worship of Godess  Lakshmi to Lord Indira. But he took the garland carelessly and put it on  his Elephant Iravadham. The garland was smashed under the feet of this  Elephant. The saint got angry and cursed Lord Indra that all his wealth  would disappear in the sea.</p>
<p>So  happened and on a particular day all the Deva's churned the sea and the  next day they got Godess Lakshmi's blessings. So that particular day of  churning was named as Ekadasi and the day next as Dhuvadasi.</p>
<p>So after regaining his wealth, Lord Indra got the dharsan of Lord Narayana at this place.</p>
<p>As Lord Indra and the Rudhirar's got the Lords dharsan, the pushkarani known as Indra Pushkarani and Rudira Pushkarani.</p>
<p>As  the Lord here vibrates all his powers as Pranava without stipping, like  a Nanda vilakku the Vimaanam here is Pranava Vimaanam.</p>
<p>All the 11 Divyadesams of Thirunaangur was created to receive Lord Shiva from his Brahma hati dhosam.</p>

<p>It's  been said that in a war between Lord Shiva and Lord Vishnu. Lord Shiva  throwed his Tirisoolam (his weapon) on Lord vishnu and he took it as his  Thiruman (Symbol in his forehead) and Lord Vishnu once held Lord  Shiva's neck tightly (while he drank the poison which came from the  Thriuparkadal) and the poison stood there and Lord Shiva was named  Neelakandan thereafter.</p>
<p>By  worshipping Lord Shiva his black throat resembles Lord Krishna's colour  and while worshipping Lord Vishnu the Thiruman stands as symbol for  Lord Shiva and thus these Lords are insisting unity among us.</p>
<p>Nara  Narayanar, is the form of Lord who became a student himself and a  teacher himself, teaching Gnana to himself as being a student and  teacher simultaneously. Lord Naryanan of Manimaada Kovil stands as a  lamp which spreads Gnana to the world and Nara Narayana of Bhadrinath  who taught Gnana to himself and thus both are equivalent in terms of  Gnana.</p>
<p>The above comparison was made by Thirumangai alwar in his paasuram "Nandha vilake! alatharkuariyay! Nara Narayanane….".</p>
<p>Usually  the Nanda vilaku is kept in an beautiful Maadam ie a structure used for  placing camps and hence this place is known as Mani Maada Kovil  containing the Lord as camp in it.</p>

<h1>ThiruChitrakoodam Temple &#8211; Chidambaram</h1>
<p><b>About Temple:</b></p>
<p>Located  215 kms South of Madras at the entrance of the erstwhile Chola kingdom,  Thiru Chitrakoodam temple in Chidambaram is home to both Saivite and  Vaishnavite Lords in Kanchipuram.In years gone by, the direction to  Thiru Chitrakoodam was given as North of the Cauvery, East of Sri  Mushnam ( Aathi Varaahan temple) and West of the Bay of Bengal.This  place is also referred to as Thillai Nagar, Chitrakoodam and Pundarika  Puram.</p>
<p>It  is believed that Cauvery's parents undertook penance at this place  uttering the name of Govinda. And were blessed with Moksham. Hence this  Lord came to be called Govindarajan. One can see the Lord in 3 postures  here- Standing, Sitting and in Bhoga Sayanam.</p>
<p><b>The Story</b><br />
Once  Nataraja (Shiva) and Thillai Kaali (Paarvathi) decided to display their  dancing expertise and to see who had better skills among the two. Shiva  looked up to Brahmma for his judgment, who asked them to perform at  Thiru Vaalan Kaadu. Unable to come to a decision, Brahmma directed them  to Vishnu, who created a dance sabha in Chitrakoodam, for the two to  display their prowess here.</p>
<p>Vishnu  is believed to have come down here and witnessed the dance contest  between Shiva and Parvathi. With Shiva's earring falling down, the  audience believed that Shiva had lost. But Shiva, continuing his dance,  picked up the earring with his leg and put it back in the ear while  continuing to dance - Oorthuva Thaandam. Parvathi couldn't match this  and Vishnu judged Shiva the winner.</p>
<p>It  is believed that Vishnu was greatly impressed with Shiva's dancing  capabilities and enjoyed Nataraja's dance duel with Thillai Kaali.  Hence, Govindarajan is seen in a sleeping posture with his face directed  towards Nataraja in the Northern direction. All forms of dance can be  seen in art form within this temple.</p>

<p><b>Chidarambaram Rahasyam</b><br />
One  can see the Chidambaram Rahasyam (the Lord in the 'form of a Yantram')  inside the sanctum of Nataraja, to his right. The Chidambaram Rahasyam  is covered with a screen and is shown to devotees at regular intervals.</p>
<p><b>Two separate temples</b><br />
In  earlier days, there seems to have been separate temples for Vishnu and  Shiva. This can be seen in Azhvaar's praise of Thillai Chitrakoodam.</p>
<p>There  is said to have been a Nataraja temple known as Chitraambalam. Siru  Ambalam signified that the Nataraja temple was small and Chitrakoodam  (the Vishnu Lord) was the bigger temple. Chozha kings are believed to  have destroyed the Vishnu temple and reconstructed the Nataraja temple  and then positioned the Vishnu temple inside.</p>

<p>There is a seperate sannidhi for the Goddess</p>
<p>Azhvaar Praise</p>
<p>Thirumangai Azhvaar has praised, in his Paasurams, Nandivarma Pallava's contribution to this temple.</p>

<p>"PainPonnum Muthum Maniyum Konarnthu<br />
Padaimanvain Pallavar kon Paninthu<br />
Sempon Manimaadangal Soozhnthu Thillaith<br />
Thiruchitra Koodan Chendru Sermindkaley"</p>
<p>Paraanthaka Chozha is also said to have contributed to this temple in the 10th Century AD.</p>
<p>Listening to Kulasekara Azhvaar's praise of the Chitrakoodam Lord is equivalent to listening to the entire Ramayana.</p>
<p>Natha Muni, the great Vaishnavite Savant was born near here, at Kattu Mannar koil.</p>
<p>Unique Occurrence</p>
<p>In  the temple tank, on the northern side, fishes come out of the water and  on to the ground to pick up eatables thrown in by the devotees.</p>

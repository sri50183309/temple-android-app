<p><b>Sthala Puranam:</b></p>
<p>The  Lord of this kshetram is known under the name "Palli Konda perumal". He  poses as Lord Ranganatha with four hands. In a way of explaining the  Unison of Lord Shiva and Vishnu, Lord Vishnu has adopted many qualities  of Lord Shiva such as dancing (Kuravai Koothu at Thiru Arimeya  Vinnagaram), Accepting Lord Chandra as a head ornament in Thirushankadu  etc, he transforms this place as his stage for dancing as Lord Shiva  took Chidambaram as his dance stage, and stys still as Ranganatha  representing stableness Shivalogam.<br />
When Lord Narayana took  the Dasawatarams, the dance which was danced by the Lord after killing  Hiranya as Narashima lots of kings as Lord Parasurama is called as  "Shankara Thandavam".Lord  Krishna dance with the Rishi's who were born as Gopikas in Gokulam is  "Aanandha Thandavam" Lord's special dance "Koda Koothu" in Thiru Arimeya  vinnagram is a splendity. The actions of Lord Varadharaja, while  testing the devotees and giving warmth to his devotees while giving  boons and showing Vishnupadham using his hands are known as "Anavaradha  thandavam" the dance of Lord Krishna on the top of the Banyan leaf as an  infant kicking and curling, sucking his toes, in the period of Pralaya  is known as "Pralaya Thandavam".</p>

<p>As  Lord Shiva showed his dances to Sivakami Parashakthi, viyakrapadhar,  Padanjali, Paanini and Nandhi deva, Lord Vishnu too has showed glimpses  of his dances to piratti Naachiyar (wife of Lord vishnu), Aadhi Shesha  Anathalwan and the herds of cows too got dharsan of his Yoga naya dance  while he was Lord Krishna at Gokulam.</p>
<p>Here the perumal is in sleeping posture. Here we may take that either he lying down before dancing or taking rest after dancing.</p>
<p>Though  the Lord is in sleeping posture his eyes would be wide all the times.  The perumal at this place is known as Shenkann Maal for he has reddish  eyes. The eye's would have become red after performing a very tough  dance or would have become red as he never closes his eyes even while  sleeping.</p>
<p>In order  to inform people that the ideal person explained in the Vedas is none  other than himself, the vimaanam is named as Vedha Vimaanam. Though the  Lord is in sleeping posture, he is guarding his devotees using Yoga Maya  and is seeing the happenings of the world through his sun like eyes. So  the Pushkarani is named as Surya Pushkarani (Suryan means Sun).</p>

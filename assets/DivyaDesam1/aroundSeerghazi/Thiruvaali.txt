<b>About the Temple:</b></p>
<p>This  temple lies in the Tanjore district of TamilNadu. It's about 6 miles  from Thirunaangur. If taken the route of Keezh salai from Thirunaangur  its about 3 1/2 miles. No arrangements for staying are furnished.</p>
<p><b>Sthalapuranam:</b></p>
<p>Thiruvaali and Thirunagari are both within 3 miles from each other are realted to the history of Thirumangai Alwar.<br />
Thirumangai  alwar was born on Thirukurayalur near Thirunagari. His orinigal name  was "Neelan" and was the Army chief (Padai Thalapathi) of the Chola  Kingdom. He was well versed in Tamil and Sanskrit.As a reward for his valor, the chola king made Neelan the king of "Aali nadu" a small state whose capital was "Thirumangai".</p>
<p>Sumangalai  was the head of the young ladies of heaven (Deva Kanni) who were  involved in the job of fanning the lord using the "Samaram". Once while  saint Kabila was preeching the qualities of Lord Narayana, Sumangali  distracted him by making an odd remark of his ugly students. So he  cursed to go to earth and take birth.</p>

<p>As a curse, she born on this earth on a lilly flower and was named as "Kumudhavalli".</p>
<p>Thirumangai Mannan wanted to marry her, but she ordered him to become a Srivaishnavan - a staunch follower of Vaishnavam.</p>

<p>He headed straight to Thirunarayur and asked the Lord to be his Guru and transform him into a pure Vaishnavity.</p>
<p>But  Kumudavalli placed another condition for marriage. She ordered him to  give food for 1008 Brahmins daily and fill his stomach by accepting the  remaining food kept by the Brahmins and drink the water used to wash  their lotus feets.</p>
<p>Thirumangai  Mannan accepted her terms and married her happily. His extreme love for  his wife, brought him into a delicate position of finding enormous  money need for the second condition. He even used the many intended to  pay the revenue to the chola king.</p>
<p>The  king ordered him to pay the revenue, but Thirumangai Mannan was unable  to repay it and so he was put in jail. He spent 3 days in the jail  without eating food for he took a vow of eating food only after giving  food to the Brahmins.</p>
<p>Varadharaja  perumal of Kanchipuram, came into his dreams and asked him to come to  the Vegavathi river bank to collect the required money.</p>

<p>So along with many Ministers, he came to Kanchi under a tight security and amazingly he found the required money.</p>
<p>But,  as the day passed on, he spent all the money he had and was not  sufficient to spend. He had no money for the further expenses, so he  made up his mind to rob money from rich people.</p>
<p>Once  Lord Narayana and Periya Piratti passed along the forest where  Thirumangai Alwar was waiting for some rich persons to pass on and so  that he could steal money and ornaments from them to serve the Brahmins.  Sriman Narayanan and Periya Piratti were dressed as a newly married  couples. While they were passing, all people around them sang lots of  marriage related songs and on hearing this, Thirumangai Mannan was so  happy that he could get lots of ornaments from them. He stopped them and  asked for all of their belongings and while the conversation between  them was going on, he took away all of their jewles from the marriage  party but could not get the precious ring of the Groom. Finally he took  the ring by bitting the Groom's finger.</p>
<p>After  that he gathered all the things and asked his servents to lift. But the  parcel was too heavy even to Thirumangai alwar. He scolded the groom in  suscipion of Chanting Manthra against him. The groom asked alwar to  come near him to know the Manthra he chanted and he preeched alwar the  most powerful "Ashtaksara Mandiram - Om Namo Narayanaya". And gave  dharsan to him in his original form and gave him the title "Nam  Kaliyan", Nam - Our, Kaliyan - Thief.</p>
<p>After  that Alwar became a true addict - devotee to Lord Narayana and totally  Mangalsasasanamed 84 Divydesams with thousand two hundred and twenty  three paasurams.</p>
<p>He  did many great things during his life time. He even built the compund  wall of Sri Rangam temple and brought Nammalwar from his isolation to  Sri Rangam for a discourse.</p>
<p>Thirumangai alwar has got two specialities:</p>
<p>He is the only alwar, who takes all the honours along with his beloved wife Kumudhavalli.</p>
<p>The  terms Nammalwar was rendered to Nammalwar by his devotee Madurakavi  alwar, who considered Nammalwar as equivalent to God. i.e The term Nam -  our was given to him by his followers.</p>

<p>But  the title "Namkaliyan" was revarded to Thirumangai alwar by the lord  god itself. ie he was so near to god and the Lord proved it by accepting  the self - Praising terms of Alwar in paasurams as the terms praising  Lord Narayana.</p>
<p>Touching  and performing pooja to the lord by the devotees itself is a North  Indian practice. He brought this concept to South India by higging the  idol of Lakshmi Narashima at Thiruvaali. The name Thiruvaali too came  for that reason only for Thiruvaali = Thiru + Aali. Aali is the term  equivalent to Alinganam ie hugging as Alwar hugged the Lord at that  place, it was named Thiruvaali</p>
<p>Also  the name "Vayalaali Manavalan" too has a special meaning. Vayal means  fields. Thirumangai alwar made the pure soles of all the devotees as  fields which cultivates Bhakti without any weeds.</p>
<p>Vayalaali means the owner of such Bhakti cultivating lands ie Thirumangai alwar.</p>
<p>As alwar hugged Lord Lakshmi Narashima, he gained the name "Vayalaai Manavalan" (Manavalan means one who is sweet to the hears).</p>
<p>Thirumangai  Alwar worshipped five Narashimaars idols througout his life. Out of  that 2 of the Narashimars and one small Utsavar idol of 'Lord Senthaiku  eniyan' are presented at Thirunagai even today.</p>
<p>At  Thirunagari, alwar poses a hunter involved in robbery. It's been said  that at Devarajapuram half mile away from Thirunagar, only Alwar robbed  Lord Narayana. Today as a token of rememberence a function "Vedupari  Utsavam" is conducted on the Panguni uthiram day.</p>
<p>As  the Lord posed as groom and bride, the Utsavar perumal at Thirunagari  is named as Kalyana Ranganathan (Kalyanam - Marriage), and Moolavar  devarajan and Vayalaali Manavalan. The vimaanam is named Ashtaksara  vimaanam for this Mandiram only changed alwars life course.</p>
<p>Thirumangai  alwar attained mukthi at Thirukurunkudi of Pandya Kingdom. While  Thirumangai Alwar's idol is taken out for procession he is armed with a  diamond studded knife. As an Homage to his practice of giving food to  Brahmins, even today 10 Brahmins get food from his temple.</p>

<p>In  the Utsavar idol of Thirumangai alwar, Namalwar is in his heart and the  great social Ramanuja following the foot steps of Alwars.</p>
<p>Thiruvaali  has a special credit of having Mangalasasanam by two great kings -  Thirumangai Alwar and Kulasekara alwar (Chera Kingdom).</p>
<p>It's to be noted that two kings - Thirumangai alwar and Nikanzhama prijapathi got perumals special dharsan.</p>

<p><b>About the Temple &amp; Location:</b></p>

<p><b>Sthala Puranam:</b></p>
<p>Here Lord Gopala Krishnan give dharsan along with his wives Rukmani and Satyabhama.</p>
<p>Vishwaksenar  the chief of the Nithyasuri's was the son of Kundalai and Lord Varuna  (Rain god). Kundalai was sent to disturb the penance of Saint Dhuruvasa  by Lord Indra was gained his curse. So, she was born as a hunter's  daughter and married pathiran a hunter. One day Lord Varuna loved her  and as a result she bore Vishwaksenar as her child.</p>
<p>Later  by his hard penance he was made the chief of Nithyasuri's the good  spirit's who live in Pramapatha and who are always near Lord Narayana.</p>

<p>He wished to have dharsan of Lord Narayana as Lord Krishna and fulfilled his wish here.</p>
<p>Rudran  was caught by Brahma Hathi dhosam, an evil spell as he killed Lord  Brahma. To over come this he prayed the Lord at Kadamba kshetram,  Kantiyur and here at this place got rid of his problem.</p>

<p>To  gain the love of god, its enough if we do our duties correctly.  Vishwaksenar and Rudran both were fully satisfied before having dharsan  of this Lord and did not requested him anything. So Lord gave his  blessing happily as he had said in Bhagavat git that if you do your  duties without expecting anything from me, I would give all the  necessary for you without your request.</p>
<p>Reason behind the name:<br />
Kavalam  means a small quantity of food. The Lord of this place gave his  blessings to Senai Thalaivar and Rudran after he got rid of his Sabham.  Here the Lord accepts the pure state of his devotees as food and so this  place is called Kavalampadi.</p>
<p>So there is no Madapalli (place to cook food for the lord hre at this temple).</p>

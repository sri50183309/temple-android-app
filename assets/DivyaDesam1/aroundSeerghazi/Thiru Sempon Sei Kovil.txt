<p><b>Sthala Puranam:</b></p>
<p>In  the Ramayana time, Rama killed Ravana who was a Brahmin. So he was  caught by the sin of killing a Brahmin. To get rid of this sin, he came  to Rameswaram to worship the Sivalingam made by Sita devi.</p>
<p>Then he came to this place and stayed in the Thrida Nethra Maharishi's Ashram.</p>

<p>According to his advice, he made a golden cow and stayed upon it for 4 days. Later he donated it to a Brahmin.</p>
<p>The  Brahmin sold the gold and constructed this temple. As the gold got from  Sri Rama was the reason behind the formation of this temple, this place  is called as "Sem Ponn Sei Kovil" where Sem Ponn means pure gold.</p>
<p>Lord  Shiva in order to get rid of his Brahmaharthi dhosam performed the  Ekadasa Rudhra Ashvametha yagam. When the Yagna was about to complete,  Lord shiva had the dharsan of Lord Narayana along with his wives Periya  Piratti, Bhoomi Piratti and Nela devi, Lord Brahma and all the devas.</p>

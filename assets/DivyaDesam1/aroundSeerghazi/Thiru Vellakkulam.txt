<h1>Thiru Vellakkulam (Annan Kovil) - Sri Srinivasa Perumal Temple, Seergazhi</h1>
<h2>About the Temple &amp; Location:</h2>
<p>This  temple lies in Thirunaangur of Tanjore district in Tamil Nadu. It's  about 7 miles away from Seerkazhi and is near to Thirunaangur. Transport  facilities are not provided.</p>
<p><b>Sthala Puranam:</b></p>
<p>Once  there was a king named Swethan, the son of Thundu maran of the Surya  dyansty. Fearing early death he sought the help of "Maruthuva  Maharishi", the son of Lord Surya the sun god. He instructed swethan to  chant the "Mrithyunjaya Manthiram" by sitting under the Tree vilvam  which was on the south bank of the pushkarani. Lord Narayanan presented  himself before the king and blessed him with a long life.</p>
<p>This  Kshetram is known as South Tirupathi. All the offering in due to the  Thiruvenkadamudayan of Tirupathi can be offered here too.</p>
<p>At  Thiruvinnagar, Lord Oppiliappan blesses along with Goddess Bhoodevi as  an equivalent form of Lord varahaswamy and Bhoodevi as Tirumala  Tirupathi. Also as an equivalent form of Lord Srinivasa and Padmavathi  Thaayar, the Lord blesses us as Thiruvellakulam as Lord Srinivasa and  Padmavathi.</p>
<p>As for the above stated reasons, both the Kshetrams are considered in equivalent with Tirumala Tirupathi.</p>

<p>Lord  Srinivasa at Vellakulam has the qualities of Lord Rama and Lord  Krishna. As lord Rama is the elder brother - Annan of Lord Krishna. So  Lord Srinivasa bears the name Annan here.<br />
As  he saved the king Swethan from the death fear he shows himself as  Varadharajan. So as the perumal stands as form representing all the  yugams the Vimaanam too has a hint of this act as Thathuva Yodhaga  Vimaanam.The  perumal thus has the names of elder and younger brother namely "Annan"  and "Kannan". Hence this temple is known as Annan Kovil. Also it is to  be noted that the perumal is also called as Narayanan. Thus this name  acts as a bridge between the similarity of Sri Rama and Venkata Krishna -  Thiruvenkadamudayan for both of them were in search of their wives  Seetha devi and Goddess Padmavathi respectively.</p>
<p>Vellam  means flood and kulam means pond. Both the terms represent water only.  As like Annan Kovil, this place has got its another name "Thiru  Vellakulam" from the above similarity. It can also taken that Lord Rama,  Balarama and Aadhi Vishnu are all of white colour. Lord Krishna is of  Blue colour the colour of water in ponds and tanks. Taking Vellam as  Vellai White colour it can also be said that the name Vellakulam was got  by the above reason.</p>

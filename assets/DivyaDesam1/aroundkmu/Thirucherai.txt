<p>After  the fall of the Vijayanagar empire in Tanjore, Azhagiya Manavala  Naicker who ruled Tanjore planned to erect a temple for Rajagopala swamy  in Mannarkudi. He appointged his minister Narasa Boopalan for this job.  He was to get Blackstones from all possible places.</p>
<p>This  minister was a great worshipper of Saranatha Perumal of Thirucherai and  wanted to erect a temple for him too. So he ordered his men to unload  one stone from each cart which passed Thirucherai. Aspy of the king  caught hold of this and informed the king. The angered king came for an  inspection.

<p>Only Divya Desam where Lord Vishnu is seen with five Goddesses</p>
<p>When  time came to destroy the world and finish the yugam, Brahma was worried  a lot. He pleaded Lord Vishnu to tell him a way to keep the tools  necessary for Srishti and all vedas safetly. Lord ordered him to put all  these things in a strong mud pot and after trying mud from all places  Brahma finally made a pot out of the sand taken from Thirucherai and  saved all vedhas and all necessary aids for srishti. Hence as this  placed gave the magical mud which held a lead role this place became the  reason for all living things to live even after the Maha pralaya so  this place is called "Sara Shetram".</p>

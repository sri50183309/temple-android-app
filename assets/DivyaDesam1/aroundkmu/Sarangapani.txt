<p>Car  festival of Sri Sarangapani Temple was held here on Wednesday.  Thousands of devotees pulled the car along the four streets around the  temple.The tastefully decorated big car (next to Tiruvarur and  Srivilliputhur temple cars) weighing 300 tonnes started from its stand  at 11.30 a.m. and went its way via the four streets and came to the  stand in the evening.</p>
<p>Earlier in the morning Sarangapani Perumal  along with Upayanachiar was taken to the car from the temple in a  procession.After arthis and pujas were performed, devotees started  pulling the car. Sarangapani Temple occupies the third place in the 108  Vaishnavite Thirupathis. Seven Alwars have done Mangalasasanam of the  Perumal.</p>
<p>Jeers  of Sri Ahobila Mutt participated in the festival. The temple has two  car festivals one falling in the Tamil month of "Chithirai" and another  in Thai. The car festival was not held for many years in between.</p>
<p>Ko.Si.  Mani, Co-operation Minister, who represents Kumbakonam constituency in  the Assembly, took efforts to run the car. The huge car was renovated  and the festival re-commenced in 2007. But encroachments on roads  hindered and delayed the movement of the car then. Now roads have been  re-laid and widened to ensure that the car festival passed off smoothly  on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Lord Aaraavamudhan is credited with helping the compilation of Naalaayira Divya Prabandham<br />
Pancha Ranga Kshetram<br />

Sarangapani Koil has maximum number of Azhvaars singing praise of Lord Vishnu after Srirangam and Tirupathi</p>
<p>The  2000 year old Sarangapani Aaraavamudhan temple is housed between two  rivers, Cauvery and Arasalaaru, in the heart of Kumbakonam, once the  capital of the Chola Kingdom. 3rd Tallest Temple Tower. This temple has  the third tallest temple tower among the Divya Desams at 150ft after  Srirangam(236ft) and Srivilliputhur(192 ft).</p>
<p>one  among the three major shrines dedicated to Lord Vishnu. The largest 11  storey gopuram is 44 meter tall and has the dancing poses of Shiva, a  rather unusual feature in a vaishnavite shrine. There are two entrances,  uttara vassal : opens when the sun reaches the tropic of Capricorn, in  the north and dakshina vassal : opens when the sun reaches the tropic of  Cancer, in the south.</p>
<p>Some  parts of the temple is believed to have been built in the 7th Century  AD by the famous Pallava King Mahendra Varma but the real construction  of the temple is said to have been done by the Cholas and later  renovated by the famous Vijayanagara King Krishnadeva Raaya.</p>
<p>In  an effort to test the patience of the Tri-Murthies and in order to find  out as to who is most patient, Sage Brigu once kicked Lord Vishnu on  the chest. An embarrassed Goddess Lakshmi left the Lord, who in search  of her came to Tirupathi. At Tirupathi, the Lord got married to Goddess  Padmavathi. To save himself from an angry Goddess Lakshmi, Lord Vishnu  is said to have hid inside a small cave here. To this day, one can see a  small Sannidhi below the earth inside this temple, near the sanctum  sanctorum.</p>
<p>Undertaking  penance to repent his arrogant action, Brigu was reborn as Hema Rishi  and Goddess Lakshmi was born as his daughter. It is said that Brigu gave  his daughter in marriage to Lord Sarangapani.</p>

<p><b>Compilation of Naalaayira Divya Prabhandham</b><br />

After  listening to the Tamil hymn "Aaraavamudhe"(3418-27) composed by  NammAzhvaar and totally swarmed by its content "Aayirathil Ippathe"( 10  verses in 1000), Vaishnavite savant Natha Muni wanted to listen to the  1000 verses of Divya Prabandham. Not knowing where to go to collect the  entire Prabandham, Natha Muni is said to have prayed here and Lord  Aaraavamudhan asked him to go to Azhvaar Tirunagari, near Tirunelveli,  to meet NammAzhvaar and to compile the works of the Divya Prabandham.  Having searched for the 1000 verses, Natha Muni actually got to compile  all the Nalaayira Divya Prabandham. Being responsible for the  compilation of the famed 4000 verses by showing Natha Muni the right  direction, the Lord here is also called "<b>Aaraavamudha Azhvaar</b>".</p>
<p>He is also called "Tamizh Vedham Thantha Vallal".</p>
<p>"Aaraavamudhe Adiyen Udalam, Ninbaal Anbaaye<br />
Neeraal Alainthu Karaiya Urukinra Nedumaale<br />
Seeraar Sennel Cauvery Veesum, SezhuNeerth ThiruKudanthai<br />
EraarKolam Thigazhak Kidanthaai, Kanden Emmaane"<br />
(Lord, I see you in resplendent reclining form in ThiruKudanthai, amidst Fertile waters and Paddy fields.)</p>
<p>ThiruMazhisai Azhvaar and "Slightly Raised Reclining Posture" of the Lord-Uthaana Sayanam<br />

Seeing  the sleeping posture of the Lord, a curious ThiruMazhisai Azhvaar  questioned if his tiredness was the reason for him to be lying down in  his sleeping posture. After hearing this, it is believed that the Lord  slightly raised his posture to greet the Azhvaar. Feeling the guilt of  having caused strain on the Lord, ThiruMazhisai Azhvaar asked him to  remain as is. And the Lord remained so ever after. To this day, one can  see the Lord in a slightly "raised reclining" posture(Uthaana Saayee).</p>
<p>"Nadantha Kaalgal Nonthatho Nadungu Nyaala Menamaaya</p>
<p>Kidantha Mei Kulungavo Vilangu Maal Varaichuram<br />
Kadantha Kaal Parappik Cauverik Karaik Kudanthaiyul<br />
Kidantha Vaare Ezhunthirunthu Pesu Vazhi Kesavane"</p>
<p>Azhvaars praising the Lord<br />
Also,  after Srirangam (11) and Tirupathi (10), the Sarangapani temple has the  maximum number of Azhvaars (7 of them) singing praise of the Lord.</p>
<p>Sarangapani  temple boasts of one of the biggest temple chariots and is  said to have  been given to the Lord by ThirumangaiAzhvaar himself.</p>
<p>Thiru Pallaandu and Sarangapani<br />

PeriyaAzhvaar  in his ThiruPallaandu refers to the Kudanthi Lord "Saarngam Ennum  Villaandaan Thannai…" ( the Lord with a 'Sarangam' bow in hand.)</p>
<p>Sanctum housed on a Chariot</p>
<p>Lord  Vishnu is said to have come down from Vaikuntam in his chariot to marry  Goddess Lakshmi here at Kudanthai. The main sanctum has been conceived  like a chariot with wheels drawn by horses and elephants and is truly a  splendid sight to watch. There are two entrances to the sanctum  sanctorum, the southern entrance and the northern entrance (each is open  for 6 months in a year). There is no straight entrance to the sanctum.  The Utsav moorthy here is regarded with the same importance as the  Moolavar.</p>
<p>As  seen in the previous story( Srirangam) Lord Ranganatha had settled down  with the Prana Vaakruthi Vimaanam on the banks of Cauvery in Srirangam.  The Lord also told Vibheeshana that he would settle down with the  Vaidheega Vimaanaam at Kudanthai. Hence, this temple is 2nd only to  Srirangam among the Divya Desams.</p>
<p>The Name ThiruKudanthai<br />
Foreseeing  some difficult times, Brahmma placed the Vedhic content, nectar and the  seeds of creation inside a pot (Kudam in Tamil), which then slipped all  the way and down to this place.</p>
<p>Shiva  pierced the pot and the nectar flowed in two parts - one into the  Mahaamagam Tank and the other into the Lotus Flower Tank. As the nectar  flowed into the tank through a pot (Kudam), this place came to be called  Thiru "Kudanthai"</p>
<p>A  visit to this temple, it is believed, will help get rid of one's past  sins, just as a trip to Kasi in the North, would. It is sacred to bathe  in the lotus water bed in the temple tank.</p>
<p>Lord does Shraadham for a Brahmin</p>

<p>Lakshmi  Narayana Swami was a brahmachari and was devoted to Lord Aaravamudhan.  It was he who built the Raja Gopuram. He was worried about his final  rites as he was a brahmachari. Pleased with his devotion, the Lord  himself is said to have performed the final rites. Also, every year, in  the Tamil month of Aipasi, the Lord is said to perform the Shradham for  Lakshmi Narayana Swami.</p>

<p><strong>About Temple:</strong></p> <br>
<p>Situated  just over 10kms from Kumbakonam on the Thiruvayaru road (about 5 kms  East of Koodalur Divya Desam), Lord Gajendra Varadhan at Kapisthalam is  in a reclining posture facing the East.</p> <br>
<p><b>History:</b></p> 
<p>Raja  Indirajimnan was a staunch devotee of Vishnu. He used to be so immersed  in his prayers that he would forget the world around him. One day, Sage  Durvasa came to see him. The Sage, renowned for his instant anger,  waited for a while but with no sign of the King coming out of his  prayers, became furious and cursed him thus- The fact that you are a  great devotee has made you arrogant and you have disrespected a Sage,  who has come to meet you. May you turn into a mad elephant.</p>
<p>Realising  his folly, Indrajimnan begged for forgiveness. The Sage who is also  know for showing sympathy agreed to reduce the impact of the curse  stating that he would continue to be devoted to the Lord as Elephant  Gajendra and that he would one day be relieved of his curse by Vishnu  himself.</p>
<p>Another  story goes that Asura Guhu once playfully pulled the legs of Sage  Agastyar while he was having bath. Angered at this act, the Sage cursed  him instantly turning the Asura into a Crocodile.</p>
<p>Legend  has it that Maha Vishnu, on his Garuda Vaahanam (a vehicle of the Lord)  rescued Elephant (King) Gajendra from the clutches of the Crocodile  (the Asura) on the banks of the river by hurling his Chakra at the  crocodile and killing it. Thus the Raja was rid of his curse and  attained Moksham.</p>
<p>This episode is known as Gajendra Moksham and is enacted here every year during the month of Panguni (March-April).</p>

<p>This is the only divya desam where the Lord provides Darshan to two animals.</p>
<p>It is a Praarthana Sthalam for Rahu</p>
<p>ThiruMazhisai Azhvaar’s only Paasuram here at Kapisthalam goes thus:</p>
<p>Kootramum Saara Koduvinaiyum Saara, Thee<br />
Maatramum Saara Vagai Arindhen<br />
Aatrankarai Kidakkum Kannan, Kadal Kidakkum Maayan,<br />
Urai Kidakkum Ullathu Enakku(2431)</p>

<p><strong>Meaning:</strong> As long as Lord Krishna, who resides in the Ocean and on the (Cauvery)  riverside, resides in me, I need not fear anyone. No demon will come  near me. With Krishna by my side, I know the way.</p>
<p>This is one of the ‘<strong>Pancha Krishna Kshetrams</strong>’ -5 Krishna Kshetrams.<br />

<h1>Sri Aandu Alakkum Ayan Perumal Temple -Thiru Aadhanoor , Kumbakonam</h1>
<h2>Temple Location &amp; Location:</h2>
<p>This  temple is situated in Tanjore district, Tamil Nadu. 2 miles away from  Swami Malai Railway station and in between Kumbakonam - Swami Malai when  we travel through bus.</p>
<p><b>Sthala Puranam:</b></p>
<p>Actually  in Tamil, "Pasu" means cow. Kaamadhenu which is known to be a cow which  is said to be good to give all sorts of wealth. During Kurma Avatharam  taken by Lord Vishnu, all sorts of good things come out of it, which is  used to the world. One of those things is Kaamadhenu, which is gifted to  Indiran, the king of swargha Lokam.</p>
<p>Pasu  (Cow)=Aa + than + oor. "Aa" means cow. Since, the Lord gave  Prathyaksham for Kaamadhenu, this sthalam is called as "Thiru  Aathanoor".</p>
<p>The  lord gives seva along with Ranganayaki Thaayar in this sthalam in  Kidantha thirukkolam and having Marakkaal (Which is used as a measuring  tool) below his head and a writing instrument, Ezhuthaani and Palm leaf  in his left head.</p>

<p>The  lord who is suppose to be the Paramaathma, resides (Urayum) on all of  the hearts, which is considered as the place of stay of him.</p>
<p>He  is seeing all the activities of Jeevaathma by going in depth to call to  cell. As the seva of this God, he holds of the leaf (Oolai Chuvadi) and  a writing instrument, he calculates the good and bad activities of all  the Jeevathmaas and based on the activities, he is ruling the  Jeevathmaas. Because of this reason this Emperumal is called as "Aandu  Alakkum Iyan", as he keeps Marakkal, measuring instrument which is used  as the measuring tool for measuring the good and bad activities.</p>
<p>His  right hand is the hand which serves all the necessary things needed for  the world (Padi alakkum Kai(hand)) and left hand for writing.</p>
<p>The  sun which is arising above the Earth is one of the way he sees the  world. The rays of the sun is the Eye of the God. All the things are  happening only after his eyes are opened.</p>
<p>He  is not only serving for the Humans, (Mankind) but also to the flowers,  rivers, mountains, animals etc. By going indepth into their body as sun  rays, he is taking them along their way.</p>
<p>Not even a single cell and its activities can escape from his suns rays in this world.</p>
<p>Because  of reason, this shethram is called as "Aadhavanulla oor", which is  laterly called as "Aadhanoor". Aadhavan means sun and at the same time  as the name implies, the pushkarani here is soorya (Soorya means sun in  tamil)pushkarani.</p>

<p>Being  good (or) bad all the activities and the thinkings of a person should  give him good and bad things. It will be even extended from his  ancesstors also. What he does will be extended to their forth coming  generation people. To write all this Good and bad activities  calculations, he is having the writing tool is his hand.</p>
<p>The  Jeevathmaa's Karma palan is well explained by this perumal of this  Thiru Aadhanoor shetram. The Emperumal is also called as "Padiyallakum  Paramadhayalu".</p>
<p>Only  in this divya desam, the body (Thirumeni) of thiru mangai alwar reside  inside the Garbhagriham (Where the moolavar is situated). But om rest of  the temples, alwars will be outside the Garbhagriham.</p>
<p>This is one of the story said along with the sthalapuranam of this temple.</p>

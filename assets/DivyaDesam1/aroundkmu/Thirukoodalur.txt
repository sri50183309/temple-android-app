<p>Thirumangai Azhvaar has 10 Pasurams in praise of the lord who is in standing posture facing the East.</p>

<p><b>Significance</b></p>

<p>As  the Devas came together at this place requesting the Lord to kill the  Asura Hiranyaaksha, this place has come to be called Koodalur(where  people come together)</p>
<p><b>The Story</b></p>
<p>1.  The Devas came together at this place and prayed to Vishnu requesting  him to kill Asura Hiranyaksha. Legend has it that Vishnu cut open the  earth, killed the Asura and reappeared, with Goddess Lakshmi, as Varaaha  Moorthy (one of the 10 Avathaarams of Maha Vishnu) at SriMushnam.</p>
<p>As  all of them came together at this place and prayed to the Lord  requesting for protection, this place has come to be called Koodalur  (where people come together). The Lord who protected the village from  the Asura has come to called JagathRakshgan- One who protects the World</p>
<p>2.  There's another story to this place: Raja Ambarishi was a pious devotee  of Vishnu, so much so that he even let go his kingdom to continue his  penance.</p>
<p>Sage  Durvasa, renowned for anger, once visited Ambarishi. With the king in  deep penanace, Durvasa, in typical style, lost his patience. Wild with  anger, Durvasa cursed Ambarishi to lose the power of his penance. The  staunch devotee that Ambarishi was, he continued to think of the Lord.  Coming to the aid of his devotee, Vishnu threw his Chakra at Sage  Durvasa, who immediately begged the Lord for forgiveness and the Lord  took back his Chakra.</p>
<p>Hence, one can find the Utsavar at this temple-JagathRakshagan- with the Chakra in his hand.</p>
<p>Pleased  with Ambarishi's penance, it is here that Vishnu gave him Darshan in  his full Divine form. Ambarishi was ecstatic at having seen the Lord in  his divine form and built a temple for the Lord at this place. It is  believed that this temple was washed away and the temple that exists now  was built later by Rani Mangammal of Madurai.</p>
<p>3.  One other story has it that River Cauvery displayed her grief to the  Lord that all the impurity/sins was being washed at the river and that  she was feeling that the river here was becoming impure and unclean. It  is believed that Cauvery regained all her glory at this place.</p>

<p><b>Specialty of the temple</b></p>
<p>There  is a jackfruit tree behind the main sannadhi and there is a big conch  (shanku) like formation on it that is said to have formed naturally when  it was being planned to cut down a portion of the tree for renovation  purpose. The formation is covered with turmeric for identification.</p>

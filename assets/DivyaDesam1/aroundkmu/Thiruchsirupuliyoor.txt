<p><b>The Deity</b></p>
<p>The bus from Kumbakonam takes an hour to reach Kollumangudi. Mayavaram will be an easy point to start with.<br />
As  per Lord Siva's directive, the sage Vyagrapadar (Pulikkal Munivar) came  to Chirupuliyur and did penance here praying to Lord Narayana to grant  him eternal bliss. The Lord obliged and the place was named after the  sage (Pulikkaal Munivar) as Chirupuliyur.<br />
The idol of Sage  Vyagrapadar is found along with that of Kanvar in the sanctum sanctorum  All episodes connected with this place are found in the fourth chapter  of the Brahmanda Puranam. Saint Thirumangai Azhwar's visit to  Chirupuliyur was not incident-free. He was not satisfied with the Lord's  image of "Balasayanam" and requested Him to show His gigantic pose. The  Lord asked the saint to go to Thirukkannamangai to witness his  Viswaroopam, according to preceptors. The Lord at Chirupuliyur is also  known by the saint in his Periya Thirumozhi verse.<br />
The Lord's  Sanskrit name is Kripasamudra Perumal. He is also known as "Saranagatha  Rakshaka Perumal," by which name the preceptors have addressed Lord  Aamaruviyappan in Therazhundur.</p>
<p><b>Darshan</b></p>
<p>The  temple was in a dilapidated condition till recently and renovation work  have begun since March 2009. There is an archaka residing nearby the  temple now a days, therefore, during the usual praying hours, it is  possible to have a very good dharshan of the the Moolavar deity in the  balasayam posture.</p>

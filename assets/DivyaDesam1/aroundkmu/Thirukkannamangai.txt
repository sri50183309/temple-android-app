<p>History behind the Names:</p>
<p>(i)  Godess Mahalakshmi performed penance in the "Shree Mandapan" of this  temple and after having a bath in the pushkarani she gave her hand to  Bhaktavatsala perumal.

It's being said that great rishi's and Yogis unable to  bear to leave the god transformed themselves as bee's adn are in his  company forever.<br />
<b>Vimanam:</b></p>

<p>(ii)  Our human soul is named Jeevatma and the soul of the great god as  Paramathma. In every Jeevathma paramathma lays on hidden position. To  explain this and to kindle the intrest of every Jeevathma to enclave  itself with the Paramathma, the god Bhaktavatsala perumal transforms his  soul and gives in place for the Jeevathma and hence, as the god mingles  his soul with those of his diciples he is known as Bhaktaraavi perumal.(iii)  As all know, Lord Krishna is always surrounded by a group of  Gobikasthree, the women of Gokulam. But in this place Lord Krishna due  to Mahalakshmi's hard penance this place is named after her Kannan's  wife (ie) Thiru Kanna Mangai.</p>

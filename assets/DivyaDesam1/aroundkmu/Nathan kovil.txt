<h1>Nathan Koil Nandipura Vinnagaram</h1>
                        
<p>Built  by the Pallava King Nandivarma, the Nathan koil in Nandipura Vinnagaram  is in the Shenbakaaranya Kshetram, which runs from here up to  Mannargudi. Unfortunately, this historic temple now wears a deserted  look and is struggling to even meet the daily pooja expenses.</p>
<p>This  Divya Desam is located about 5kms South West of Kumbakonam and about 3  kms East of Pateeswaram near Korukkai, in a village not easily  accessible by road. While the road leading to this temple is very  narrow, it would be a nice gesture on the part of the Kumbakonam State  Bus Transport service to run services to this temple, especially on  weekends.</p>
<p>Goddess  Lakshmi wanted to reside in the heart of Lord Vishnu. She undertook a  penance at this place facing East. It is said that the Lord appeared  before her (facing west) and accepted her wishes.</p>
<p>Nandi's curse<br />
Legend  has it that Nandi, the vehicle of Shiva, wanted to meet Lord Vishnu at  Vaikuntam and entered without securing the permission of the security  guards (Dwarapalakas) of Vishnu. This angered the Dwarapaalakaas who  cursed the Nandi.</p>
<p>Nandi  looked up to Lord Shiva for solution, who wanted him to undertake  penance at the place, which was South of Kumbakonam, North of  Mannargudi, West of OppiliAppan (Vinnagar) and East of Srirangam, one  where Goddess Lakshmi herself had undertaken penance previously.</p>

<p>Accordingly,  Nandi undertook penance here to seek atonement for insulting the  Dwarapaalakaas. Pleased with the prayers, Vishnu appeared before him.  Nandi requested Lord Vishnu that this place be named after him. Hence,  the name Nandipura Vinnagaram. An image of Nandi can be seen on one of  the walls of the temple.</p>
<p>Another  story goes that Vishnu, who originally faced the east, turned westward  to look at the spectacle of King Sibi saving a bird by providing flesh  from his thighs.</p>
<p>Owned by Vaanamaamalai Mutt<br />
The  temple is owned and maintained by Vaanamaamalai Mutt. The Mutt would do  well to bring more devotees to the temple as well as take care of the  priest and other people working at this temple. While one finds huge  crowds at OppiliAppan temple, a few kms away from here, this Divya Desam  looks rather deserted. However, it is quite commendable that the priest  and cook perform all the 6 pooja services with utmost sincerity.</p>
<p>It is the belief that fights between husband and wife will be solved if one visits this divya desam on the Ashtami day.</p>
<p>Need of the hour for this temple</p>
<p>1. A bus route from Kumbakonam to Nandipura vinnagaram<br />
2. A mini bus service from Kumbakonam/Pateeswaram<br />
3. Increase the salary of the priest, cook by about Rs. 500 per month<br />

4. Devotees to look at contributing pooja items to this temple so the daily poojas could be conducted without difficulty</p>

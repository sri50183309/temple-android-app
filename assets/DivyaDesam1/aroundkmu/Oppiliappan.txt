<p><b>Legend</b></p>
<p>Once  Sage Markandeya prayed for children. Being pleased by his prayers,  Goddess Bhumi Devi was reborn as his daughter near a Tulsi Plant. As the  days passed, Lord Uppiliyappan came in disguise as an old man and  sought marriage to Sage Markandeya. Rishi also accepted, but he was  worried. He told Lord that his daughter is very young and does not know  even to put salt in food and also does not know about household things.  Lord accepted that whatever she cooked he would eat showing mercy  towards the Rishi Markandeya. Marriage was held in pomp and Glory.

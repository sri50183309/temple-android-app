<h1><b> Pulla Bhoothankudi </b> </h1>
<p>Saint  Poets Azhvaars (there were 12 of them including Andaal) were ardent  devotees of Vishnu. These saint poets composed verses in Tamil and  revitalized the religious spirit sparking off a renewal of devotional  worship, referred to as the Bhakti movement. The Azhvaars visited Vishnu  temples and sung praises in the name of the Lord. Such temples have  come to be known as Divya Desams. The compilation of the verses (known  as Paasurams) is the revered Naalayira Divya Prabandam(4000 verses)</p>
<p>There  are 108 Divya Desams in all, out of which over 80 are in Tamil Nadu. 40  of these temples are in the Chola region (Trichy-Thanjavur-Kumbakonam  belt), 22 are in the Kanchipuram-Chennai region, 2 in Nadu  Naadu(Cuddalore..) and 18 in Pandya Kingdom - Madurai/Tirunelveli  belt.There are 13 in Kerala and 11 in North India.(2 are out of the  world)</p>
<p>In these  temples, Vishnu is represented usually in one of three postures -  reclining(Sayanam), seated(Amarntha) or standing(Ninra) posture.</p>
<p>Thiru  Mangai Azhvaar has sung praise of the lord in 86 Divya Desams followed  by Nammazhvaar in 37 Divya Desams.Among the temples where maximum number  of Azhvaars have sung praises, Srirangam leads with 11 Azhvaars having  sung praise , followed by Tirupathi, where 10 Azhvaars have sung praise  of the Lord and Kumbakonam Sarangapani( 7 Azhvaars).</p>
<p>1. Pulla Boothangkudi - Liberation from Parental Curse -Jataayu Moksham</p>
<p>Situated  about 10kms from Kumbakonam, this Divya Desam's legendary tale dates  back to the time of Ramayana.In search of Sita, Raama reaches this place  to the cries of the Eagle King Jataayu, which was breathing its last.</p>

<p>The  Eagle King, an old friend of King Dasharatha (father of Raama) had  fought a valiant battle trying to rescue Sita from Raavana, before the  Lankan king finally cut off both its wings. Lying in pain and unable to  fly any further, the bird breathed its last uttering the words " Raama  Raama" and informing him that Sita had been taken away by Raavana.</p>
<p>Legend  has it that Raama, who had not been able to perform the last rites for  his father as he was away in the forest, derived some consolation by  performing his obsequies and giving moksham to the Bird. In the  Raamayana, this episode is referred to as the death of the 2nd father.It  is believed that those who failed to perform last rites for their  father(parents) will get liberation from their 'parental curse' (Pithru  Saabham Nivarthi) if they visit this temple.</p>
<p>While  performing the last rites, Raama felt the absence of Sita. It is  believed that Goddess Lakshmi came out of the Golden Lotus temple tank  to stand by his side while he performed the last rites for the bird.  Hence, Thaayar here is called Potraamaraiyaal.</p>
<p>The  story also goes that Thirumangai Alwar who passed that way did not take  notice of a tired Raama, who was relaxing in a sleeping posture under  the tree after performing the last rites, and ignored the Lord mistaking  him for a Kshatriya.Realising this, Raama gave darshan to Thirumangai  Alwar in 'Full Divine Form'- with Conch- Disc and four hands.</p>
<p>Thirumangai  Alwar starts his 10 Pasurams here with the verse that reads " I have  passed the Lord without realizing who HE is..." - 'Arivathariyaan Anaithu  Ulagum Udayaan Ennai Aal Udayaan...Pulla Bhoothang Kudi thaane."</p>
<p>This  is the only temple where Raama is in the reclining posture with all his  ornaments and 4 hands. Sita is not seen with the moolavar, as this  temple relates to the time when Raama is separated from her.</p>
<p>Many  devotees have got employment after visiting Yoga Narasimhar (a separate  sannadhi within the temple), so much so that the devotees have named it  the Udyoga Narasimhar.</p>
<p>This temple is administered by Ahobila Matam.</p>

<p>Sage  Gavalaa Maharishi had 360 daughters. He was very much worried to get  them married. He prayed to Lord Vishnu. The Lord who resides here  promised the sage that he would marry one daughter a day and married all  the 360 in a year. So the Lord here is called as 'Nithya Kalyana  Perumal'. It is also told that Lord then immediately converted all the  daughters into one and kept on left lap. Hence the name is called  "ThiruVidandai".</p>

<p><b>Sri Nithyakalyanar Mahatyam</b></p>
<p>Sage  Markandeya and King Mahabali had visited the kshetram. Even today many  pilgrims come here and get the blessings of Lord Nithyakalyana Perumal.  Those who wants to get married would be offering two garlands to Lord.  After Puja, the priest would give one of the garlands. The person should  wear that garland and do Pradakshinam. This is practiced, so that  marriage would be fixed soon to the bhaktas.</p>

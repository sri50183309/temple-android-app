<p><b>Specialty of the temple<br />
</b><br />
It is believed that if unmarried boys and girls come to the temple and  offer prayers to the lord, they would find their life partners soon. The  devotee has to offer garland to the lord and do pradakshina wearing the  same garland. Then the garland has to be kept in the puja room. Doing  so, would grant the wish of the devotee to find a suitable spouse at the  earliest.</p>

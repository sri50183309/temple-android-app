<h1>Ninra Narayanan Temple - Thiru Thangal</h1>
                        
<p>The Andaal Divya Desam at Srivilliputhur is about 25Kms(West) from here.</p>
<p>A war of words between the 3 Devis</p>
<p>A  fight arose between the three Devis- Sri Devi, BhooDevi and NeelaDevi-  as to who was the senior most among the three and the favourite of the  Lord. To prove her status, SriDevi came down to this place and undertook  penance near the 'Thangala hills'. Pleased with her prayers, Lord  Vishnu appeared before her and acknowledged that she was his favourite.  In memory of this event, this place came to be called 'Sri' Puram. It is  believed that Bhoodevi and Neeladevi agreed with this verdict of the  Lord and decided to stay here at this place.</p>
<p>Every  year, on the 5th day of the Tamil month of Aadi, ThiruThangal Appan  goes to SriVilliputhur, about 25kms from here. PeriyaAzhvaar praises the  Lord in the morning, while Garuda Sevai is a special feature in the  evening. The next morning, 6th day of Aadi, ThiruThangal Appan takes  flowers from Andaal, another unique occurrence.</p>
<p><b>11 idols inside the sanctum</b><br />
Inside  the sanctum, one can see as many as 11 idols, the only Divya Desam to  have these many idols within the sanctum. The idols are: Deiveeka  Vasudevan, Sridevi, Neeladevi, Bhoomadevi, Brigu Rishi, Markandeya  Rishi, Garuda, Arunan (Suryan's Charioteer), Anirudhan, Ushai and  Jambavathi (only temple to have an image of Jambavathi).</p>

<p><b>Garuda and Serpent Lord Aadhiseshan</b><br />
A  unique feature at this Divya Desam is that Garuda is seen along with  his traditional enemy, 'The Serpent Lord Aadhiseshan'. Garuda is also  seen adorned with jewellery.</p>
<p>Krishna's grandson wedding at ThiruThangal<br />
Krishna's  grandson Anirudhan got married at this place to Baanaasuran's daughter  Ushai. It is believed that Deiveega Vasudevan came down to attend this  wedding.</p>
<p>A fight between Sacred Banyan tree and Aadhiseshan<br />
Once  a fight arose between a sacred Banyan tree and Aadhiseshan as to who  was more powerful. They went up to Brahmma who decided in favour of  Aadhiseshan as it was on the Serpant Lord that Lord Vishnu slept.  Unhappy with Brahmma's decision, the sacred tree undertook penance  seeking Vishnu's blessings. The Lord asked him to go to ThiruThangal and  take the form of a hill. Fulfilling his wish, the Lord would come there  to the hill and accept SriDevi, who was undertaking penance, at the  foot of the hill.</p>

<p><b> Sthlapuranam :</b></p>
<p>In  Ramayana, Ravana, took away sita and captured her as a prisoner in  Lanka. Sri Ramar, on hearing the action performed by Ravana, had to take  proper and immediate action to get out Sitapiratti from Ravana. But,  Ravana's brother Vibheeshanan who lived along with him doesn't liked the  low act of Ravan and advised him to return Sitapiratti to Sri Rama,  else the whole Lanka might get into danger.</p>
<p>On  hearing the advise from Vibheeshanan, Ravana got angry on him and asked  him to get out of Lanka and join along with Sri Rama. Vibheeshanan came  out from Lanka and fell down to the divine feet of Sri Rama and  explained him that Sita Piratti is kept as the prisoner in Lanka. Since,  Vibheeshanan finally fell down to the feet of Sri Ramar for complete  Saranagathi, this sthalam is also named as "Saranagathi" Kshetram.</p>

<p>Sri  Ramar, stayed along with Sugreev, Hanuman, Vibeeshanan and other Vanara  senais and discussed with all of them that how to get out Sita piratti  from Lanka. He stayed in this Pullani sthalam and did tapas in Sayana  Kolam on Dharbaipull (the grass) for sevan days without eating anything.  Since because of doing tapas on the grass and showed his sayana kolam  in the pull (grass), this sthalam is called "Thiruppullani". Pull means  the grass and the Anai means the bed and since Sri Ramar showed his  sayana kolam in Pullani, this sthalam is called as "Pullani". Sri Ramar  worshipped the Aadhi Jagannatha perumal and prayed him to help him out  to get Sita piratti. As satisfied by the worship of Sri Ramar, Aadhi  Jagannatha perumal gave him the Bow and because of this, the perumal is  also named as "Deivasilaiyar" and Divya Sapan.</p>
<p>Thiruppullani  is located near Sethu Samudhram shore (Sethu Karai). Sri Ramar could  not know how to cross the huge ocean and got the advise from Vibheeshana  that they can cross the ocean only if all the water dries. He advised  Sri Ramer that he can ask the Samudhara Raja to get dried and can make  them the way towards the Lanka. On getting the advise from Vibheeshana,  Sri Ramar seeked the help of the Samudhara Rajan. But he doesnt show any  response for Sri Ramar. Sri Ramar worshipped before the Samudhara Rajan  to make the way, but since there was not response from him, Sri Ramar  got angry and threatened against samudhara Rajan that if he doesnt make  them the way, he would make the ocean dry completely. On hearing the  threatened words from Sri Ramar, Samudhara Raja was frightened and came  out from the ocean along with his wife Varuni and fell down on the feet  of Sri Ramar as Saranagathi. Inspite of Vibheeshanan got the  saranagathi, samudhara Rajan and his wife Varuni also got the  saranagathi and thereby justifies that this Kshetram is given the name  as "Saranagathi Kshetram".</p>
<p>After  this, the Samudhara Rajan made the ocean to become quite and asked Sri  Ramar to build a bridge, so that they can travel through it to reach  Lanka.</p>
<p>As  advised by Varunan, Nalan and all the other Monkeys (Vanara Senai)  started to build a bridge and this bridge is called as "Sethu Anai",  since this is constructed along the Sethu Karai (Shore). And finally  crossing through this bride to Lanka, Sri Ramar fought with Ravana and  killed him and got out Sita Piratti.</p>
<p>Kanva  rishi, Who was Maha rishi stayed in this sthalam and did a strong tapas  against the perumal without having any food. On satisfied with the  tapas of Kalvar Rishi, Emperumaan gave his seva and asked for the Varam  that he should be always along with him and continue to help him. The  perumal agreed his words and continued to help him.<br />
Once  there lived a rishi by named Devala Maharishi and did a strong tapas on  the perumal. He started his tapas after taking the bath and started the  tapas. When he was doing the tapas, seven deva Kanyas came down to this  sthalam and wanted to take a bath in the small river. They enjoyed that  moment and all of them forgot themselves. Their enjoyment made them to  forget them to give the proper respect to Devalar Maharishi and on  seeing this act of the Sapta deva Kanyas, he gave them the sabham of all  of them to become Yatchars (ordinary humans with less minded). On  getting the sabham, allthe 7 deva Kayas felt for it and realised their  mistake and asked Devalar Maharishi that how could they get out from the  curse. Devalar Maharishi asked them to get to Pullaranyam  (Thriuppullani) and get the help from pullar Maharishi, so that he can  help them to get out of the Sabham.All  the sevan deva Kanyas reached Thiruppullani fell down to the feet of  pullar Maharishi. They all told him about the sabham got from Devalar  Maharishi and he had advised all of them to get the help of pullar  Maharishi to get out of the curse. Pullar Maharishi advised all the 7  Kanyas to stay in Thiruppullani and worship the Aadhi Jagannatha perumal  and he is the only person who can make them to get out of the sabham.  When Sri Ramar came to this pullaranya kshetram, his eyes glanced on all  the 7 deva kanyas and at that moment all of them were out of the sabham  and once again reached the deva lokam.</p>

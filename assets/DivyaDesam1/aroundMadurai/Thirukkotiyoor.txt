<h1>Sri Uraga Mellanayaan Perumal Temple -Thirukkotiyoor</h1>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>About the Temple &amp; Location:</b></p>
<p>This  sthalam is one of the divya desam found in Thiruppathoor taluk  Ramanathapuram district in Tamil Nadu. 7 miles away from Thiruppathoor,  which is found nearer to Melloor and around 70 miles away from Madurai.  We can go to this sthalam from Karaikudi also. Lots of bus facility is  available.</p>
<p><b>Sthlapuranam :</b></p>
<p>In  this sthalam, a Kadambha Maharishi had a big Ashram, where lots of  vedas and spiritual teachings are taught and the rishis and the people  around the Ashram lived in peace.</p>
<p>At  that time, an Asuran by named "Hiranyan" gave lots of problems to  rishis, devas and all the other people and all of them wanted to find a  safest place. They could not protest Hiranyan, since he was very strong  and has got lots of soliders, so, the rishis yogis and the Devas thought  it is safe to get on to an unreachable place. Thinking Kadambha  Maharishi's Ashram might be the safest place, they all seeked the help  of Sriman Narayanan to kill him there by retaining the peace, once  again. Sriman Narayanan, Lord Brahma all the devas and along with the  rishis, discussed about the killing of the Asuran, Hiranyan. And finally  after the discussion, Sriman Narayanan decided to the Narahimha  avathaar, whose head being the head of the lion and rest of the body as  an ordinary human. Since, Hiranyan had got the Varam in such a way that  he should not be killed by an ordinary human, Sriman Narayanan has to  take this avathaar to destroy and kill him. Since, all the rishis, devas  and along with Sriman Narayanan and Lord Brahma met all at one place  and discussed, this sthalam is called as "Goshtiyoor". Goshti means all  the devas along with Sriman Naryanan grouped together and met in this,  sthalam this sthalam is called as "Goshtiyoor" (or) Goshti Kshetram.</p>
<p>Kadambha  Maharishi had an unlimited bhakti towards both Emperumaan, Sriman  Narayanan and as well as Lord Shivan. In thirukkarambanoor, he did the  tapas towards the Emperumaan and in Nagapattnam, towards Lord Shiva and  got his Mukti, worshipped all the Mum - Moorthies in this sthalam.</p>

<p>When  knowing about the sthalapuranam of Thirugoshtiyoor, an another peculiar  issue has to be explained which deals witht he story of Sri Ramanujar  and Thirugostiyoor Nambi.Thriugostiyoor  is the birth place of Thirugostiyoor Nambi, who is also named as "Selva  Nambi". He was the guru of Sri Ramanujar, who was preached with the  "Ashtakshara Mantram".</p>
<p>But,  the way he was taught the Ashtakshara Mantram was one of main issue  that has to be explained. Selva Nambi ordered Sri Ramanujar to do the  fasting in this sthalam. Having crossed the age of 60, to get the  Mantram, he followed the order of Selva Nambi. He took only water as his  food and one fine day, he was preached witht he Ashtakshara Mantram for  which he was waiting for. But, he was ordered by Selva Nambi that the  Mantram should not be published to any one and it should be kept secret.</p>
<p>But  on hearing the Mantram, he thought it is not only a secret thing that  is helpful and useful for him only, but it should be made public to all  and it should be useful for all the other people. As a result of his  thought, he went straight to the temple of Sowmya Narayana perumal and  stood on the huge walls of it and all of the village people to gather.  And once all the people gathered, he loudly pronounced the Ashtakshara  Mantram, which is said to sacred and explained it to all. He also asked  them to repeat it. On hearing this, Selva Nambi got angry on Sri  Ramanujar since he has not obeyed his words and has broken the promise  that he had given to him. Then, he called up Sri Ramanujar and said that  having broken the promise, he will have to pay for the mistake, and as a  result, he will be going to the hell. But before that, Thirugoshtiyoor  Nambi (Selva Nambi) wanted to know the reason why he made the  Ashtakshara Mantram so public? But, Sri Ramanujar aswered that in this  world, all the things belongs to Sriman Naryanan and no other thing  should be kept scret (or) themselves but it should be used to others. As  the same way, on explaining the Mantram to all, it might help them from  many things and because of this reason only, he answered that he  publicised the Mantram. On hearing this from Sri Ramanujar, Selva Nambi  realised how his mind was narrowed and felt for it. But, at the same  time he was attracted by the thinking of Sri Ramanujar towards humanity  and vaishnavism. As a result of it, Selva Nambi called Sri Ramanujar as  his Emperumaanar. We can find two separate statues that is made of  bronze for Thirugoshtiyoor Nambi and Sri Ramanujar in this temple.</p>
<p>After hearing the story of Sri Ramanujar and Selva Nambi and also the Sthalapuranam, let us know about the temple.</p>
<p>On  reaching the temple, one can see the Vimaanam which is very big and  widely spread. On entering the temple is the mandapam named  "Thirumaamani Mandapam", where Lord Shiva gives his seva as  "Sarabeshwarar". He originated on his own (Suyambhu) and as a result of  not caring properly, it was in the damaged condition. On the south  direction of the Mandapam, a separate sannadhi for Lord Narasimhar and  on the North side, a separate sannadhi for Sri Ramar are found. It is  said that in front of this Narasimhar sannadhi only, Sri Ramanujar was  taught the "Ashtakshara Mantram" from selva Nambi.</p>
<p>In  the upper tier, we can find Moolavar, "Thiru paarkadal Nathan" also  named as "Uraga Mellanayaan" (or) Sthiti Narayanan is found in  Veetrirundha thirukkolam and on the either side of him is periya and  Bhoomi piratti are found. It is said that utsavar, Sowmya Narayana  perumal and other 3 pirattiyaar's idols are given by Indiran to Kadambha  Maharishi. On the south side of Ashtanga vimaanam, a separate sannadhi  for Thirumaa magal Naachiyaar and on the North side, there is a separate  sannadhi for Sri Aandal is found.</p>
<p>In  the middle thalam (or) tier, we can see Nindra Narayanan along with  Periya piratti and Bhoomi piratti in Nindra Kolam and he is also named  as "Upendran". Here, we can find lots of various architectural works  pertaining to the Indra Loka scenes and saptha rishis. Lots of Painting  and artistic works like Desavathaaram, devas, Munis and suriyan and  Alwars are found.</p>

<p>On  the outer pragaram on the North side, there are two sculptures of  Narasimhar is found, which explains the Hiranya Vadham (Killing of  Hiranyan).</p>
<p>But,  initially one of the statue is kept in Narasimhar sannadhi in the first  tier and another one is Sri Ramar Sannadhi. But, it is said that on  seeing the statues of Ugraha Narasimhar, people are frightened, so later  these two statues are kept close to the paramapadha vaasal (entrance).  Udayavar, Emperumaanar Sri Ramanujar statue is found on the top of the  Vimaanam facing the village and this sthalam is so called as "Dhvayam  (two) vilaindha thirupadhi".</p>
<p>This  sthalam explains all the necessary actions (or) moral to the people of  the world. No one can destroy the enemy as a single person, but if as a  team, we can achieve anything and it is well explained by the action  performed by Sriman Narayanan to get the divine nector for the devas.  And another incident is the action performed by Sri Ramanujar by  explaining the Ashtakshara Mantram to the world. As an extension of  this, Udayavr Sri Ramanujar who is the hamsam of Aadhiseshan, is serving  as the bed for the Emperumaan.</p>

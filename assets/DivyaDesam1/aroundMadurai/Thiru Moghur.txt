Sthlapuranam :</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Long ago, the Indiran (Indra) and all the other devas were given the curse (sabham) to loose all of their wealth and their power. They got frightened on the Asurars and sought the help of Sriman Narayanan. To regain their lost power, Sri Emperumaan said that he will help them out in gaining their lost power and advised them to get out the Amirdham (nector) from the paarkadal.<br />
At the same time, the Asuras also wanted their existing power to increase, thereby came to extract the Amirdham (Nectar) from paarkadal. At that time, Sri Vishnu to the Avathaar of Kurma, thereby helping to extract the nector.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The devars are found on one side and the Asuras are found on the other side, thereby trying to extract the Nector. The first thing to come of it is the "Kaala Khoota Visham" (the poison). Since, this being a dreadful poison, Lord Shiva came and swallowed it and thereby got the name as "Neela Kandan". Since the person's body turns blue after the poison taken, and since the poison stayed on the neck of Lord Shiva, he is given the name as "Neela Kandan" Neela - means blue and Kandan - means the neck.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">And after the poison came out, lots of good things came out of it to enrich the world. Dhanvanthri, the doctor of perumal, 60 crores dancing Rambhais, their friends, a horse by named "Ucchai Siravaran", the spiritual and the wealth giving cow, the Kaama dhenu, Iyaravadha elephant,which was given as the Vaahanam (Vehicle) of Indiran, Kousthuvamani, Sri Lakshmi, Moodevi the tree Karpaga Virutsham, the tree that gives lots of wealth. Varuna Kumari Vaaruni came out. These are the things that emerged out of the Paarkadal, while the Asuraas and the Devars where trying to extract the Amirdham.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">And finally, the Amirdham, for which they we trying to get came from Paarkadal. Sriman Narayanan doesnt want it to go to the Asuras since that might even increase the strength of them, more. So to help out the Devars in regaining their power, he took an another form (or) avathaar of Mohini, a beautiful women. The beauty of the Mohini could be explained, since she was so beautiful and the people who see her gets disturbed. The Emperumaan, who took the form of Mohini and decided that he will distribute the Amirdham for both Devas and Asuraas. They both agreed for this. On seeing the beauty of Mohini, the Asuraas didn't care much about the Amirtham and all were attracted by the beauty of Mohini. At that time, Sriman Narayanan gave all the Amirdham to the Devars and helped them in getting back their lost power.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
There is another sweet story of why the Lord Sriman Narayaba took the Mohini avathaar. Sri Lakshmi, who came out of the Paarkadal was so beautiful women in the world. But, by taking Mohini Avathaar the perumal has reduced her thought that she is not only the beautiful women, but many are there.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">On seeing the beauty of Mohini avathaar, Lord Shiva was too got attracted towards the beauty and as a result of this only from the Gnana eye of Lord Shiva, Lord Iyyappan was born. The name "Moghur" was given to this sthalam, only because of the beauty of Mohini avathaar taken by Sriman Narayanan.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Moghur Emperumaan, who is also called as "Kaalameghap perumal" is resembling in posture like Sri Varadharajar is found in Kanchi, having the Gadha in his left hand and the right hand is positioned in such way that it gives the varam for hsi bhaktas in Nindra kolam facing east direction.<br />
The temple is surrounded by huge walls and outside the temple we found the "Ksheeraapthi Pushkarani". First is found the entrance of the temple which is facing to the east direction on entering in to the Vaasal, we can find the "Kambatthadi Mandapam". In this mandapam, the stone carved beautiful statues of chinna Marudhu and Periya Marudhu statues are found, who helped for the welfare of this temple. Next to it is found the Garuda Mandapam. In this mandapam, we can see the sculptures of Kothanda Ramar, Sita piratti, Lakshmanan, Kama devan, Rathi devi are found and also a small sannadhi for Garudan is found after this mandapam.<br />
As we enter the temple, on the southern side, a separate sannadhi for the perumal is found where he gives his seva in Sayana thirukkolam (Sleeping kolam) along with Sridevi and Bhoomi pirattiyaar. He is found underneath the Aadhiseshan, the bed of the perumal. There are also 7 sayana thirukkolam of this perumal is found and they are :<br />

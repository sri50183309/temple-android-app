<p> <b> Sthlapuranam :</b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This sthalam is situated in Madurai, which is famous for all the temples found here. And, Madurai is famous for the Meenakshi Amman temple. All the Devas of the Lokam and Munivar came all together for the Meenakshi Amman to Sivaperumaan in this sthalam and because of this, the sthalam is called as "Koodal". Koodal means all of the persons (or) group of people coming (or) joining together. Sivaperumaanwho is the entire structure of Gnanam, and Sakthi are married to each other, and the Paramathma, Sri Emperumaan is assisting and helped them in getting married. Gnanam, sakthi, Beauty, Bhakti and wealth are joined together on the same place and they give their Kalyana seva to the entire world. When Konedu Maaran Sri Vallabha devan was ruling the city, Periyalwar on seeing the beauty of Azhagar, he sang the great, "Thiruppallanndu" in praise of Azhagar.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Sownaka Maharishi, when he was doing the Tapas, he was covered by the small mud mountain (Putru). Yayaathi's daughter, while she was playing there, found two bright lights flashed from inside of the putru. But it was actually the eyes of Sownaka Maharishi. She took a small stick and poked his eyes. As a result of this, Sownakar got angry and gave her the sabham that all the childrens that are born to Yayaathi's daughter will be blind. Hearing this, she felt sorry for that and asked for Sabha Vimochana. Cooled by her devotion, Sownaka Maharishi, he himself married Yayaathi's daughter and earned 100 childrens and one among them was Janaka Maharishi.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A Pandiyan king by named Sathyavrathan, devoted this Koodal Azhagar and had a great belief towards him. One day, when he went to worship Koodal Azhagar. But before going into the temple, he washed his hands in the Kirutha maala river, where a fish was found in his hand. He thought that the fish might be the Emperumaan, Since fish was one of the Avathaars of Sri vishnu. Because of this only, the Pandiya Kings in their flags have the fish as the symbol.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Another great thing that has to be said about this temple is the great Raja Gopuram, which is very big with lots of architectural works found in it. In the first pragharam there is a separate sannadhi for Madura valli Naachiyaar. Meenakshi Amman, who is made up by Maragatham and to remember her, this sthala thaayar is named as "Maragadha Valli". On the North side, a separate sannadhi for Aandal Naachiyaar is found.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This sthala perumal is found in 3 thalam (ie) in the bottom thalam, he is found as Koodal Azhagar in Veetriruntha kolam, in the second thalam (middle one) he is found as "Andhara Vaanathu Empiraan in Kidantha kolam and int he Upper thalam, he is found as Sooriya Narayanan in Nindra thirukkolam.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Specials:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In all the Vaishnava temple, the Navagraha Sannadhis will not be found and will be found only in Lord Shiva or in Saiva temples. But in this sthalam, a separate sannadhi for Navagrahas are found. This is to imply that both Vaishnavam and Saivam should be considered as the Single God but not as separate Gods.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In this sthalam only, Periyalwar sang his great Thiruppallandu, which is sang in praise of the Emperumaan and as a result of this, he got the Prathyaksham of Sriman Narayanan as "Koodal Azhagar".</p>

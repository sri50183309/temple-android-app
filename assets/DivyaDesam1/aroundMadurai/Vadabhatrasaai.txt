<p><b>Legends:</b></p>
<p>The name Villiputtur stems from the legend that this town was built by two hunters Villi and Puttan. Legend has it that Periyalwar a devotee of Vatapatrasaayee, served the temple, by fashioning garlands out of fresh flowers from the garden which he maintained. Andal his daughter (discovered in the temple garden) was in the habit of wearing the garland prior to submitting them to the deity. An aghast Periyalwar, tried to stop Andal's deed, and was directed by the deity, that he indeed preferred garlands which had been worn by Andal, and hence Andal's name 'Soodittanda Sudarkkodi'. It is believed that Andal left her mortal body and merged with Ranganathar.</p>

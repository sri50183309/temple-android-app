<p >Periya Pirattiyaar did a strong tapas against Sriman Narayanan. On becoming happy and fully satisfied on her tapas, Sriman Narayanan gave him the Varam that she will become the hamsam of Annapoorani by offering food and shelter to the people of this entire world and said she is the combined and total structure of all the other naayakis - Aanandha Nayaki, Sridevi, Neeladevi and Amirutha Nayaki. And as further to this, the sthalam will be named as "Sripuram" and these are the Varam (Which is given as the prize who satisfies the perumal) given for Sengamala Thaayar. Since, Thirumagal stayed in this sthalam and did the tapas, this sthalam is named as "Thiru thangal". (Thangal means the place of stay).</p>

But, he gave him a promise that in the Krishna Avathar, he can catch hold of him and will be given in Ramavathar, Jaambhavan in Krishnavathar, came towards Krishna to steal the Siyamanthaka mani, for which they bought for s8 days. In Vaamanavathar, he asked Sri Vishnu that he should be killed only by his weapon, Chakkaram. As a result of this, he was killed on the 28th day and at that time, Sri Krishnar made him to remember his past. Jaambhavan was so happy that he was killed by a great person, who takes care of the entire world and asked for a final help to Sri Emperumaan that he should marry her only daughter, Jaambhavathi.

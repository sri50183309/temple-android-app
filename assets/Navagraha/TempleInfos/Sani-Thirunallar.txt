<p><b>History:</b></p>
<div>Lord Sani Bhagavan at Thirunallar</div>
<p>As per the history of the temple, the great King Nala of Puranic fame was relieved of the affliction of Lord Saturn or Lord Saneeswaran after worshipping the Lord consecreted in this temple.Whoever visits this temple and prays before Lord Saneeswaran is believed to have been relieved of all the curses and sufferings and get the blessings of Lord for a happy and prosperous life.</p>
<p>When the Planet Saturn transits between zodiac signs, literally millions throng this shrine. The Legendary King Nala is said to have been relieved of his affictions, which were due to the malefic influence of Saturn, after worships in this temple.</p>

<p>The moolavar of Dharbarenyeswarar is Swayambu Lingam.Poojas are performed 6 times(6 kalams) by the Brahmin priests.Poojas like Ashtothra Archana, Abhishegam, Sahasranama Archana and Navagraha Shanthi Homam are performed daily but Homams are not accepted on Saturdays.Facilities are also available to perform the following poojas on behalf of devotees and to send the prasadam (viboothy and kumkum) by post who wish to pay the prescribed amount.The Important festivals celebrated in the temple are the following :-<br />

Apart from these festivals, Special Abhishegam are also held in the Temple throughout the year on important occassions.</p>
<p><b> </b><b> </b></p>
<p>Among the Navagrahas, Lord Saturn (Saneeswarar) occupies an important place.</p>
<p>A malefic Saturn in one's horoscope is believed to cause miseries and hardships which can be mitigated by worshipping him.According to astrology, Saneeswaran moves from one sign (house) to the next in the Zodiac once in 2-1/2 years and the day of his transit is observed as a festival in Thirunallar.</p>
<p>On the day previous to the day of transit, religious discourses and entertainments are arranged.On the festival day, Thiruppavai and Thiruvembavai are chanted at 5.00 a.m. An Abhishegam on a grant scale is performed for the Lord Saneeswara Baghavan.Oil, Milk, Curd, Rose-Water, Tender Coconut water, Fruit juice etc., are used for the Abhishegam.</p>

<p>The place was originally a forest of Dharba grass and it is stated that the Lingam even now has impressions left by the Dharba weeds within which it was situated.The Lord here is also known as "ADHIMOORTHY or NALLARAR".The great Saivite saints Thirugnanasambhandar, Sundaramurthy Swamigal, Thirunavukkarasar and Arunagirinadhar have worshipped at this shrine and sung about the glory of the Lord.</p>
<p><b>"PACHAI PADHIGAM" </b>sung by the great saint Thirugnanasambhandar is very famous one.<br />
Of the numerous tanks theertams, the Nala theertam is the important one. By bathing here, it is belived that one washes off all kinds of misfortune , afflictions and to escape from the woes of sani. Saniswara or Saturn, is generally known to affect one adversely on occasions when he occupies certain positions in one's horoscope.A prayer to him, especially on Saturdays, is said to mitigate the hardships one will have to face during these periods. Saniswara is considered equally a bestower of all benefits to the devotees who pray sincerely to him. He is ruled by Lord Yama.<br />
Mantra for Saturn - Aum aing hring shring shung shanaishcharaye namah aum<br />

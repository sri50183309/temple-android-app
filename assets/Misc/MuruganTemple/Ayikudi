The main temple that enshrines  Lord Muruga as Swaminadha swami is known as Mel Koil. There are several  small temples around the Meenakshi Sundareswarar temple. As we enter the  2nd Prakaram, there is a very beautiful structure that portrays the  teaching of Omkara by Muruga to Lord shiva.

along  with s tatues of several other gods and goddesses including  Karthaveeryarjuna, Idumban and subramanya swamy. As we approach the  sanctum sanctorum, we pass across worshipping Sabhabathi, Senapathi,  Shanmuka with Valli and Devasena – all being various manifestations of  Lord Kumara or Karthikeya.</p>
<p>There  is a beautiful statue of Nataraja or dancing Lord Shiva as well. Poet  Saint Arunagirinathar – who sings about this temple in detail in this  sacred Tamil hymn Thiruppugazh is also represented in the form of an  idol here. The main lord of swami malai – affectionately called as  Swaminadha – is 6 feet tall with broad shoulders holding sakthi vel and  dhandam(staff). Instead of Mayil Vahanam or the peacock vehicle,  Elephant is depicted as the vahana (divine vehicle) in front of the  lord.

<strong>The         History</p>
<p></strong> Swamimalai is one of the very ancient temples of Tamil Nadu.  One can see         that it is mentioned in Thirumurukaatrup-padai of  Nakeerar, compiled         under ‘paththuppaattu’ (Ten  verses) of Sangam period, which belongs         to second century B.C.  The shrine therefore is evidently older than         2400 years. It is  believed to have been constructed by Parantaka Chola         I. But  recent history and documentation show that the temple was damaged          to a great extent and the gopurams were demolished during the  Anglo-French war of 1740 A.D.</p>

<p>The  temple of Swaminatha is built on the hillock. At the foot of the  hillock, there is a temple for Lord Shiva, who played the ‘Taught’. His  temple is situated at a lower plane to indicate the superiority of the  ‘Master.’ Lord Shiva is known as Sundaresa and His Consort, Meenakshi.</p>
<p>There  are three beautiful gopurams on all three sides &#8211; east, west and north.  On the south is situated the massive and main gopuram, known as the  Rajagopuram. There are three prakarams in the temple. There is a shrine  for Vinayaka, who is known by the name Netra Vinayaka. It is said that a  blind man had his vision restored, after he worshipped Vinayaka here  and from then on, Ganesa is known as Netra Vinayaka in Swamimalai.</p>
<p>There  are other shrines in the prakaram for Agastya, Visalakshi, Lakshmi,  Saraswathi and other deities. There is a shrine for Lord Muruga in a  corner, where He resides with His consort, Devayani. This is the only  shrine where Subrahmanya is seen with Devayani alone, without the other  Consort, Valli. Moreover, the usual divine vehicle, peacock is absent in  this shrine. Instead, there is a white elephant is found in front of  the Lord. It is said that Indra, in gratitude for having saved him from  Asuras, presented the Lord with his own vehicle, Airavatam, the white  elephant and hence the peacock is absent in Swamimalai.</p>
<p>Krittika  is an important day for a visit to the shrine. The main festivals are  Brahma Utsavam, Skanda Shasti and the festival of His marriage with  Valli. Vibuthi Abhishekam &#8211; smearing of the deity with holy ashes &#8211; is a  special feature in Swamimalai, as it is in Palani.</p>

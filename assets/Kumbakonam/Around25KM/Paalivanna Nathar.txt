<p style="text-align: justify;">Sri Kirathamoorti bear the impress of the antiquity about them. </p> <br>

The image of Lord Subramanya, enshrined in this part of the temple, is a rare specimen. It has six heads but only six hands holding different kinds of weapons. There is an excellent collection of silver Vahanas (palanquins) used to carry the deities at festival times.<br />
Legend Connected With The Temple </p> <br>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Tradition goes to say that during the Mahapralaya  (Great Floods) after Dwaparayuga a Kumbam’ (Pot) full of Amritham (also spelt as Amrit) and seeds for creation was set afloat by Lord Shiva. It was proclaimed by Shiva Himself that the place where the pot touched theground and had its rest would be considered as the holiest places in the world.<br />
Since the said Kumbam, as announced by the creator of the world, had its rest in this place, this ancient place is named as Kumbakonam after that Kumbam. Immediately after its rest Lord Shiva appeared in the guise of a hunter and broke thesaid Kumbam full of Amritham with his arrow.<br />
The nectar settled at two places one of which became the famous Mahamaham Tank. Out of the pieces of the broken pot Lord Shiva made out a ShivaLinga and entered into it. This is now enshrined in the temple, and hence the name Adi Kumbeswara, meaning  one who entered the Kumba or vessel long long ago.<br />
It is to be noted that this MahaLinga unlike other Lingas found in other temples, is not made of granite stone and as such Abishekams (also spelt as Abhisheka) cannot be performed with watery substances lest it should dissolve the shape of the Linga (also spelt as lingam). </p> <br>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Idol Of Kirathamoorti</strong><br />
The idol of Kirathamoorti is a special feature in the temple and it is a standing monument to commemorate the incidence that, Lord Shiva Himself has created the present MahaLinga.<br />
The Shaivaite Saints, Appar and Sambandhar who flourished prior to the 7th century AD have sung devotional songs (Thevarams) in praise of the presiding deities of the temple. </p> <br>

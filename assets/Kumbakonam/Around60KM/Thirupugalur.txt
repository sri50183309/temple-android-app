<p>Mahavishnu sent SriChakra to kill Jalantharasuran a demon. SriChakra went to Patalaloka killed the demon and emerged unscathed from 
river Cauvery at Kumbakonam and placed himself on the hands of Brahma who was bathing in the holy river. 
Happy and overjoyed Brahma consecrated the SriChakra at the place where the temple is constructed.Surya one of the nine planets of 
the Navagrahas became jealous of Srichakra&#8217;s radiance tried to become more luminous then Sri Chakra.</p>

<p>He thus humbled Surya by becoming more bright and absorbed Surya&#8217;s rays into him there by making Surya loose his brilliance. This temple is situated on the southern bank of Cauvery in Kumbakonam Railway station, Thanjavur district, Tamilnadu. It is the second Vaishnavite temple in Kumbakonam town. Here the main deity is Chakraraja and Sudharshana Chakra.</p> <br>

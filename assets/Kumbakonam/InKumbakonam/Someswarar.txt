<h1>Someswarar Temple</h1> <br>

<p><strong>About Temple:</strong> <br />
<p> Somessar temple is situated in the southern portion of Sri Sarangapani temple. This temple is facing the northern side with a small Gopuram at the eastern portion near the entrance. The architectural style and element of this temple resembles the Dravidian Architecture of 13th century of Chola period. Arumugam and Thenar Mozhi Ammal are the other deities located in this temple complex.</p> <br>

<p>The main deities here are Someswarar and Soma Sundari Amman. This is believed to be the place where the thread tying the pot fell. However, the most interesting thing about this temple is not the main deity, but the idol of Muruga, which is in the outer Pragaram of the temple. This idol of Subrahmanya is unique, for he is depicted wearing Sandals (padukas), something not seen anywhere else.</p>
